%\subsection{High Directional Link}

\input{DirectionalLink} %Isn't this supposed to be a subsection of the penetrator to lander link?

==== Trans Ice Communications Presentation
    -Fiber optical cables are heavy.
    -Repeaters require RTGs with a high interval. Number of repeaters is highly depending on ice conditinos
    -One-to-one communication link through the ice is a better alternative.
CONCLUSION: Fiber optical cable is not a good option, cable is going to be enormous.
            One-to-one communication must be researched further - more details are required.
            Repeater communication must be researched further.
            
==== Communications Presentation
-Ice link:
-Surface relay:
-Ground control link:
One-to-one communication, assuming poor ice conditions, link is possible
Surface to orbiter. Small tracking possibilities, low directivity antenna is used.
3m high gain antenna.
CONCLUSION: One-to-one communication must be researched further. More details are needed
            The antenna transmitting down through the ice must be aligned. High risk, as landing site will probably not be flat.
