\autsection{Communication Systems Proposal}{Kristian Sloth Lauszus, Rasmus Lundby Pedersen, and Gustavo Feij√≥o Carrillo}

Two main factors carry the most weight for the performance of the communications in this mission, the link through the ice crust of Europa where its impurity composition and concentration poses a high risk. And, the limited transmission windows that each flyby allows due to the Jupiter-Europa resonant orbit that is suitable for a longer life span of the mission.

For the first problem, a tethered solution is quickly set aside due to mass and bulk constraints and a wireless approach is the must reasonable. The embedding of transceivers and antenna elements in ice requires better modeling of the effects that the temperature and impurity levels have in the antennas, for the transceiver electronics, the main concern is low power condition and low temperature. The low power may be reduced to the lander subsystem since the main mission RTG as electric energy and heat is with the penetrator vehicle, making the power source at the lander the weaker piece in the system. If a small RTG should be left at the surface, half-dulex communication in a burst mode for power harvesting with capacitors may be achieved and give the ability to reach the depth of design. On the other end this same half-duplex concept applies to the penetartor, where the majority of the electric energy may be diverted for communications during the main descent phase and then in a time allocation scheme for relaying science data from the ocean interface.

%==== Trans Ice Communications Presentation
%    -Fiber optical cables are heavy.
%    -Repeaters require RTGs with a high interval. Number of repeaters is highly depending on ice conditinos
%    -One-to-one communication link through the ice is a better alternative.
%CONCLUSION: Fiber optical cable is not a good option, cable is going to be enormous.
%            One-to-one communication must be researched further - more details are required.
%            Repeater communication must be researched further.

%==== Communications Presentation
%-Ice link:
%-Surface relay:
%-Ground control link:
%One-to-one communication, assuming poor ice conditions, link is possible
%Surface to orbiter. Small tracking possibilities, low gain antenna (LGA) is used.
%3.2m high gain antenna.
%CONCLUSION: One-to-one communication must be researched further. More details are needed
%            The antenna transmitting down through the ice must be aligned. High risk, as landing site will probably not be flat.
%
%* Repeaters along decent path
%	* Increases a lot when introducing salinity
%	* Pros:
%		* Scalable
%	* Cons:
%		* Complexity
%		* Separate RTGs
%	* Too complex
%		* Better just use one proper designed unit in the penetrator
%		* Might be a combinations of repeaters and a big antenna at the lander and probe
%		* Will also work better if the probe doesn't descent in a straight line.
%
%	* Also a combination of repeaters and tether could be used.
%	* The repeater will also work better if the penetrator move to the side. Repeaters do not risk breaking like the tether.
%	* If one repeater fails the data rate will drop by a factor 10 or more, so we have a little redundancy.
