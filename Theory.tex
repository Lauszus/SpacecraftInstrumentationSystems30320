\section{Ice characteristics}
In this section the different theories about the ice characteristics will be presented. This includes the structural profile and a simplified calculation of the ice temperature profile. Furthermore the concept of water convection will be presented, as it might eliminate the needs for low-pressure pump system to circulate the water into the different instruments.

\autsubsection{Structural Profile}{Rasmus Lundby Pedersen}\label{sec:structural_profile}

The first space probe flybys took place in the early 1970s, and Europa quickly became one of the main focuses in the search for past or present extraterrestrial life-harbouring environments, within reachable distances. Already in the 1960's were it discovered from earth-based observations, that the surface of Europa was covered in solid ice, not much unlike other satellites located that deep in the cold reaches of our solar-system. However, data recovered from satellite flybys supplied us with new information about the geology and composition of the moon's surface, having since helped us understanding the of Jupiter's, arguably, most interesting moons with respect to life-supporting environments.\\

The Voayger mission from the late 1970's sent back coarse imagery of Europa with resolution in the ranges of kilometres per pixel, carrying valuable information about the surface of the Jovian satellite\cite{VoyagImg}. More specifically, the images showed a surface resembling that of a ball of string, discarding theories of Europa having a smooth surface, with it in stead being full of bands and ridges.\\%See requested article from DTU Findit

The high-resolution measurements showed what seemed to be blocks of ice filled with ridges and/or early cracks, that had been lifted and rotated at some point in time. These disruptions indicates that there might be a liquid or softer slushy layer underneath the solid ice surface that through movement had broken and relocated the ice-crust. These cracks are illustrated on fig. \ref{fig:SurfCrack}, which is one picture of a series from the 1989 Galileo satellite\cite{HidOcean}. In any case, it indicates that there is some kind of structural activity in the outermost layer of the moon.\\

% Surface Composition
As explained in the study made by the Space Studies Board's Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration (COMPLEX), the data from Galileo’s Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) show that the water-ice absorption of Europa doesn't match with the expected outcome of pure-water ice, even for areas where the level of frozen sulfur oxide is thought to be lowest (The source of this $SO_2$ is presumably volcanic eruption on Io.). There has been some theories on the cause of this, including the presence of salts and other minerals in the ice but recent studies show that bubbles and fractions could result in the same discrepancies and band shifts in the measurements. However, it is still believed that some of the darker spots seen on the moon are observed because of salts and minerals like hexahedrite, epsomite, and natron\cite{SciStrat}. % INDSÆT The identity of that contaminant so far eludes scientists, but sulfur or iron compounds are suspected from Hidden Ocean P. 8
\\
\\
The actual thickness of the theorized ice-crust, and even the complete structural model of the moon, is still subject to many discussions. It was previously (prior to the Galileo mission) believed that the moon could be consisting of a hydrated silicate core coated in a thin layer of water-ice. However, with the measurements of Europa's gravitational field done by the Galileo satellite has this theory since been largely debunked. The current popular belief is that the cores is either a solid or fluid metallic core surrounded by a layer of water and ice of more than 100km due to the estimated density of the Jovian body. \\
The global ratio between liquid and solid water-ice is still unknown since it must be based on assumptions about the internal structure of the ice, which in themselves are extremely uncertain. The estimates we do have are even based on local imagery, since making them on a global basis requires dedicated orbiter mission, like the planned CLIPPER mission.\\%INDSÆT REFERENCE
In one study, the impact craters of Europa are analysed and compared with computer simulations to estimate regional crust thickness. The rationale is, that central peaks found in craters on the surface resemble material uplift caused by meteor impacts on extraterrestrial planets\cite{ThickImpact}, as seen on fig. \ref{fig:ImpactPic}. Therefore, it is assumed that the crust is thick enough to prevent complete surface penetration from meteor impact and as such they conclude that the ice at the impact sites must have been more than 	$\mathbf{3-4km}$ thick. Graphical representation of the simulation results can be seen on fig. \ref{fig:ImpactSim}. Another study that also investigated the impact craters, and taken from their introduction: "Stereo topographic profiles suggest that the plateau [a plateau SW of Cilix impact crater] is
flexurally supported, with an effective elastic thickness $t_e$ of
$~6km$. For a conductive temperature profile this $t_e$ value
implies a solid ice shell thickness of $\mathbf{~15km}$; if the shell is
convecting, this estimate is a lower bound. Combined with
independent estimates, we infer a probable shell thickness
of $\mathbf{25 km}$. The shell thickness is likely to be uniform over
the entire satellite."\cite{ThermElast}

Thermal models has also been used to estimate the average ice shell thickness of Europa. One study is carried out with the assumption of a ice shell decoupled from a silicate core by a layer of liquid water \cite{ThermThick}, so its conclusion may not fit with modern theories. They estimate the shell to have a thickness of $\mathbf{13-25km}$, depending on which thermal rheology model is used (Maxwell and general flow rheology, with and without heat flow from the core). Another thermal model is based on the suggestios of Europa having a metallic core and a silicate mantle, covered by significant layer of liquid water and a thinner ice shell \cite{ThermThick2}. The study heavily relies on convection in the ice, and this complicates the study further. The heat flow through the ice is dependant on the shell thickness, and shell thickness is in turn dependant on the heat flow. This study concludes on the result that the average thickness of a completely frozen shell must be around $\mathbf{36km}$ based on the study's assumptions.
\\
\\ One study carried out by [J.M. Wahr, M.T. Zuber et al., 2006] analyses the tidal effects caused by the differentiating gravitational pull from Jupiter, as Europa travels in its elliptical orbit around the planet. The result of the study is a set of analytical equations estimating the global thickness based on the Love-number of Europa. However, in order to utilize these equations, accurate knowledge of the ice-composition is required, as well as precise estimates of the Love numbers. In the end they even conclude conclude that their results may not be sufficient since they only provide an accuracy of $\pm 5\mathrm{km}$.\\

Apart from the thickness and elemental composition of the ice, internal structure in the shelf is also highly relevant to the planned penetrator mission. Assuming a completely homogeneous ice-shelf is a crude over-simplification and may be a mission-killer if alternatives aren't considered.

As such, apparent "Chaos Regions" has been observed on the surface of Europa and their causes has for a long time alluded scientists. However, recent studies suggests that these are formed due to water lenses in the shell, which can also be interpreted as lakes of liquid water \cite{IceLakes}. They way even be present within $3km$ of the surface, and it is estimated that there may be a water lense consisting of $20,000 - 60,000km^3$ of liquid water beneath the so-called Thera Macula chaos region. An artistic illustration of this phenomenon is shown on fig \ref{fig: ArtLake}.

\autsection{Ice Losses}{Nissopoulos Ioannis}
\label{sec:ice_losses}

As we expect, Europa's subsurface consists mainly of several kilometres of ice, which we want to penetrate with electromagnetic waves to establish the communication link between the penetrator and the lander vehicle. Fortunately, a lot of research has been made in the recent decades on how efficient an electromagnetic wave can penetrate different ice layers and on which parameters can affect this propagation. These principles are applied widely in subsurface radar sounding that take place in polar areas, but also in planetary exploration (Mars). For a wide range of frequencies, ranging from MHz to GHz, dielectric losses of ice are independent of frequency. By that it is meant that, the number of wavelengths, which can penetrate into ice before being attenuated to a given fraction of its initial amplitude ($1/e$ of initial amplitude) is approximately the same regardless of frequency. The above implies that the longer the wavelength, the deeper the radar signal can penetrate before being attenuated below the detection of our equipment. Thus, deep ice penetration requires that the radar operates at the lowest possible frequency. 

\paragraph{Dielectric properties of ice}
(For the following two paragraphs \cite{Kofman_2010} has used as main reference.)The permittivity $\epsilon$ of a material is a property describing how much more energy is stored though change separation than in vacuum. Frequency dependence of permittivity occurs because change separation does not happen instantaneously. Changes separate with finite velocities, thus if the external field is reversing polarity too quickly the changes cannot move fast enough to keep up. The frequency at which the charges fully separate and are in constant motion is called the relaxation frequency. At frequencies below the relaxation frequency the permittivity plateaus at the low frequency limit (static) $\epsilon_{s}$, which is often call dielectric constant. At high frequencies above the relaxation frequency the permittivity plateaus at the high frequency limit $\epsilon_{\infty}$. Moreover, ice crystal formation has an impact on polarization, which primarily depends on temperature.

Debye model takes into account the above mentioned theory about dielectric constant of ice and is described by the following equations: 

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon=\epsilon_{\infty}+\Delta \epsilon \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{1+j \omega \tau}
    \label{eq:dielectric}
\end{equation}

, where $\omega = 2\pi f$, $\Delta \epsilon=\epsilon_{s} -\epsilon_{\infty}$ and $\tau$ is the dielectric relaxation time. \\
The permittivity is a complex function of frequency and usually is described by its real and imaginary part.

\begin{equation}
    Re (\epsilon)=\epsilon_{\infty}+\Delta \epsilon \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{1+ \omega^2 \tau^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    Im (\epsilon)=\frac{\Delta \epsilon\ \omega\  \tau}{1+ \omega^2 \tau^2}
\end{equation}
The loss tangent (tan $\delta$) is defined by the ratio of these two parts and characterizes the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves in a medium due to ohmic conductivity $\sigma$. 

\begin{equation}
    tan \delta=\frac{Re(\epsilon)}{Im(\epsilon)}=\frac{\sigma}{\omega\ Re(\epsilon)}
    \label{eq:tan}
\end{equation}
The conductivity $\sigma$ of the medium is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant.

Because of the complexity of equations (\ref{eq:dielectric} - \ref{eq:tan}) an approximated expression has been developed to compute the attenuation.

\begin{align}\label{eq:losses}
    a &= 0.129 \sqrt{Re(\epsilon)}\ f (\sqrt{1+tan^2 \delta}-1)^{1/2} \\ \nonumber
      &\approx 0.091 \sqrt{Re(\epsilon)}\ f\ tan \delta \\ \nonumber
      &\approx 0.0009\ \sigma\ dB/m
\end{align}
Where, $\sigma$ is in $\mu S m^{-1}$. As one can see from eq. (\ref{eq:losses}), attenuation's value is directly proportional to frequency, or in other words to the conductivity of the medium. Additionally, the static dielectric constant of pure ice is heavily depended on the orientation of electric field with respect to the crystal's axis. The effect of pressure is about 1\% per kbar for polycrystalline ice \cite{Kofman_2010}. The above formulas and their approximations concerning the electromagnetic waves can be used adequately for very low temperatures, as the ranges we are interested.

Nevertheless, the losses due to pure ice are well documented in bibliography, there is a big gap regarding ice impurities on icy moons. The absence of these data are due to uncertainties and lack of knowledge of the physical nature of impurities on these satellites. This problem was studied by  Moore \cite{Moore_2000} and Chyba \cite{Chyba_1998} for Europa. Moore considered three types of water ice on Europa, produced by three basic processes occurring on Earth. The first one is meteoric ice formed by atmospheric precipitations, sea ice formed by the freezing of water close to the atmospheric interface and marine ice forming beneath ice shelves directly from ocean water. Moore concluded that similar processes are likely to occur on Europa as well, and that the most probable form of ice would be marine ice. In figure \ref{fig:impurities} Moore sums up the attenuation from different type of impurities in ice \cite{Moore_2000}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/Moore2.jpg}
\caption{Attenuation, $a$, is in dB/km at 251 K and corresponds to the one way attenuation due to  ice impurities, in case of a sounding radar. Columns I, II, and III are computed one-way attenuation, in dB/km, for ice shells with base temperatures of 270, 260, and 250 K, respectively. The range of values for each of these corresponds to surface temperatures of 50 and 100 K. These values are independent of shell thickness since the temperature profile is stretched to the ice thickness. The M column represents the plausibility of the ice type for Europa; 0 is least likely while 3 is more likely, given the present understanding
of Europa. The distribution coefficients $k_{0}$ and $k_{MI}$ affecting the marine ice models come from laboratory experiments \cite{Moore_2000}.}
\label{fig:impurities}
\end{figure}
The above calculations data are not taking into account a possible scattering mechanism of electromagnetic wave due to ice layers that can exist in the crust. The scattering effect has a significant impact on the attenuation level and depends strongly on the dimensions of cavities in the medium compared to the wavelength. The two main mechanisms of scattering coming from the ice crust are surface scattering and scattering by volume irregularities. Both these effects can change considerably the penetration depth of the wave into the ice, but also the ratio of any subsurface echo to surface clutter. As we can understand the scattering depends strongly on the wavelength and surface parameters of the body under investigation. 

The conclusion is that the expected one way attenuation because of impurities of ice is in the range 1-8 dB/Km and this number is independent of the frequency. Although, the frequency dependence of attenuation due to scattering mechanisms dictates the use of as low frequencies as possible in order to achieve a deep penetration. The main bottlenecks in that case are two. The first one is that the choice of frequency has an influence on the characteristics of instrumentation and especially on the size of the antenna and the second one is Jupiter's radio emissions spectrum. Figure \ref{fig:J_spec} depicts how Jupiter's activity affect the electromagnetic environment of its moons. Clearly can be seen that frequencies from almost zero Hz up to 50 MHz are dominated from Jupiter's radio emissions. Thus, the exact choice of frequency results in a trade off between science requirements and technical limitations taking into account also the physical constraints of the environment under research.

\autsection{Radiation Shielding Theory}{Jean-Paul Breuer}
With regards to the instrumentation on board, there will need to be some type of shielding as protection against harmful radiation as well as from the potential heat generated by the RTG. Whenever gamma radiation passes through matter, it undergoes absorption via Compton, photoelectric, and pair-production interactions. Therefore, the intensity of the emitted radiation decreases as a function of thickness and density of the absorbing material, as stated by the Beer-Lambert law,
\begin{equation}
I = I_0 e^{-\alpha x}
\end{equation}

rearranging the relation and taking the log of both sides gives,\\
\begin{equation}
\ln\left( \frac{l_0}{l}\right) = \alpha x
\end{equation}

where then finding the half value layer (HVL), or where the initial intensity is halfed, can be computed through,\\
\begin{equation}
\ln(2) = \alpha x_{1/2} \Rightarrow x_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{\alpha} \label{halfthickness}
\end{equation}
In other words, the more dense the material, the less thickness will be required to effectively attenuate the radiation. However, as mentioned previously, whenever radiation passes through matter, there are several interactions that can occur, including X-ray fluorescence.

The transition energy between two electron shells within an atom (typically higher shells K,L,M,+) is the same as the energy of characteristic radiation for that element, which manifests itself as the inner-shell ionization by an accelerated electron. Naturally, ionization can occur in several different electron levels, forming a characteristic spectrum for each element, since all transition energies are unique to each atom. This transition of an excited atom into a lower energy occurs via the photoelectric effect, where radiation ejects inner shell electrons, whereby electrons from the outer shells are transfered into the inner shells to fill in the vacancies, emitting a photon in the X-ray range that is unique to that element with energy equal to the transition energy $E_c = E_m - E_n$. This is the case for elements with higher atomic numbers; however, for elements with low atomic numbers, the Auger effect tends to dominate, where instead of the energy being emitted as a photon, it instead is transfered to another electron which is then ejected from the atom.

The empirical law for the characteristic X-ray emission from an atom is given by Moseley's Law,\\
\begin{equation}
E_c= R_h \cdot (Z-\sigma)^2 \left(\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{m^2}\right)\label{moseley:eq}
\end{equation}

where $R_h$ is the Rydberg constant, $Z$ is the atomic number, and $\sigma$ is the screening constant of the atom. It is then possible to estimate the energy of a $K_\alpha$ transition via the relation,\\
\begin{equation}
E_{K_\alpha} = A \cdot (Z-1)^2 \label{transition}
\end{equation}
where $A = 10.22$ eV is the $K_\alpha$ transition in hydrogen. Following Equation \ref{transition}, it is evident that every element has its own characteristic fingerprint, but more importantly, to create an effective shielding, it will be required to use several layers with different materials, to gradually attenuate all of the energy to a point where it will no longer damage the sensitive instrumentation. Given that the Orbiter will be orbiting Jupiter, with a heavy radiation environment, it will be very important to minimize the radiation as much as possible, especially during the Lander phase of the mission when the equipment will be most exposed to the harmful radiation from the planet.
