\chapter{Theory}


\section{Moon Characteristics} % JP, Yannis

* Rock core, water, ice

    * Why do we think so?
    
    * Geysers?
    
\subsection{Radiation Environment} % Maja, "landing site guys", "orbiter guys"

* Both for the orbiter and the lander

\subsection{Tidal Wave} % Lukas, KSL

\section{Ice characteristics} % Lukas, KSL

\subsection{Temperature Profile}

* "back of the envelope" calculations

\subsection{Pressure Profile}

* What is the outside pressure?

\subsection{Structural Profile}

* Ice thickness

* Composition of the ice? % Se: SWRI: "barr-showman-2009" (ask Kristian Lauszus)

* Lakes?

\subsection{Simulation Results}

\subsection{Simulation Validation}

* Should show that the "back of the envelope" calculations are right

\section{What Defines Life?} % Agge, Fruzsi

* Water, oil, fat, carbon, energy

* Proteins (amino acids) etc

* Nutritions, water, heat energy

* How can a life-form be able to convert thermal energy to other forms of energy

* Another energy source could be geysers on the solid core

    * A probe to the ocean bottom might show this
    
* Lakes inside the ice

* Iron-reduction

\subsection{Where do we expect to find life?}

* Top or bottom of the water?

* Petri Dish can be used for cultivation

* Steralization of the spacecraft: chemical, heat, radiation
