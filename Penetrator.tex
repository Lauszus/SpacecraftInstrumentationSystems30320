\section{Drilling Methods}

\autsubsection{Mechanical Drilling}{Morten Lykke Hilligsøe}
On earth, drilling is by far the most common way of penetrating ice and has proved a viable way for recovering ice core samples at depths of up to 3.768km, reaching the underground lake Vostock, much like the mission at hand. Drilling has previously reached depths of 12.262km, and because of e.g. the oil drilling industry, experience and components are readily available. It is therefore obvious to look at the possibility of drilling through the ice on Europa.

To compare with other ice penetration methods, the following key parameters are evaluated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Energy
	\item Time
	\item Weight
\end{itemize}
The energy required for a drill solution consists of two parts: the cutting energy and the potential energy required to move the ice. To calculate these energies, the following assumptions have been made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Probe length:   $2m$
	\item Probe diameter:   $30cm$
	\item Europa surface gravity:   $1,3m/s^2$
	\item Europa ice density:   $124kg/m^3$
	\item Specific ice cutting energy:   $16MJ/m^3$
\end{itemize}
For cutting energy, the key parameter is the specific cutting energy. This parameter is assumed to be $16MJ/m^3$, as measured by \cite{icecore}. Other sources, e.g. \cite{extremeenvironments}, have measured specific cutting energies of similar size, at $20MJ/m^3$.

The result is a cutting energy of:
\begin{equation}
    E_{Cut} = A \cdot E_{Specific}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    E_{Cut} = (0.15m)^2 \cdot \pi \cdot 16MJ/m^3 \cdot 1000m/km = 1.130 MJ/km
\end{equation}
The potential energy required to move the ice, will have to at least match the volume of ice which the penetrator probe displaces.  The result is a minimum potential energy of:
\begin{multline}
E_{pot} = m \cdot g \cdot h = \rho \cdot V \cdot g \cdot h\\
 = (0.15m)^2 \cdot \pi \cdot 124kg/m^3 \cdot 1.3m/s^2 \cdot 2m \cdot 1000m/km = 22.8 kJ/km
\end{multline}
Where the surface gravity of Europa is provided by \cite{wiki_europa}, and the ice density $\rho$ is calculated from the value on earth at -180°C as stated in \cite{wiki_water}:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{Europa} = \rho_{Earth} \cdot \frac{g_{Europa}}{g_{Earth}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho_{Europa} = 934kg/m^3 \cdot \frac{9.82m/s^2}{1.3m/s^2} = 124kg/m^3
\end{equation}
Compared to the cutting energy, the potential energy seems insignificant. However, this might not be a realistic assumption, since the shaved ice will most likely take up more space than the equivalent amount of solid ice, and will therefore have to either be moved additionally, or compressed. Also, the drilling equipment will most likely take up a much greater volume than the probe itself, and this energy must therefore be expected to increase in multifold.

But even if the energy required to drill through the ice is reasonable, drilling time and system weight are key parameters. Table \ref{tab:ice_core_drilling} presents these key parameter for two currently employed methods of ice drilling: Ice Core Drilling (ICD) and Hot-Water Drilling (HWD), as well as a solution based on Coiled Tubing Drillling for Ice (CTDI), which have yet to be employed in ice drilling projects. As seen from this table, drilling a 3.5km borehole can take as little as 6-8 days by using a CTDI system. However, the weights of such systems are in the tens-hundreds of tonnes, making ice drilling systems impossible to bring as payload on a rocket.

\autsection{Pressure Distribution on Europa}{Ricard Lladó Grove} \label{sec:Pressure}
Europa's atmosphere is extremely thin: approximately $10^{-11}$ times smaller than the atmosphere of Earth\cite{hall1995a}. Hereby it can be approximated that there is no pressure on the surface of Europa which means that the pressure will only depend on ice-layer above the penetrator which will increase in thickness while descending. The pressure can be calculated by: 
\begin{equation}
P = \rho_{ice} g h
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{ice}$ is the density of ice and is approximately $\SI{917}{\kilo\gram\per\cubic\metre}$\cite{cutnell2007a}, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration measured in $m/s^2$ and $h$ is the depth of the penetrator. The gravitational acceleration can be calculated by following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:graviacc}
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}
\end{equation} 
where $G = 6.67\cdot 10^{-11}\frac{m^3}{s^2 kg}$ is the gravitational constant, $M = 4.8\cdot 10^{22}\text{kg}$ is the mass of Europa and $r = \SI{1569}{\km}$ is the radius of Europa\cite{website:propeuropa}. Equation \ref{eq:graviacc} is only valid if the mass of the penetrator is much smaller than the mass of Europa which is a valid approximation since the total mass of the penetrator will maximum be 180 kg. In the following it is assumed that Europa is a symmetrically sphere. Hereby the gravitational acceleration depends on the depth of the penetrator since the radius of the sphere will decrease and so will the mass. The radius decreases with a factor $r^2$ but since the mass of a sphere is proportional to $r^3$ which means that $g$ is linear proportional to $r$. This means that the gravitational acceleration will decrease the closer to the core of Europa the penetrator is and if in the center of Europa the gravitaional acceleration would be the same in all directions which means they would cancel out. This is a consequence of Newton's shell theorem if assuming that Europa's mass distribution is completely uniform \cite{website:shelltheorem}. This is not the case for Europa since we know that the top layer of Europa is ice. In figure \ref{fig:Pressure} the pressure in MPa inside Europa is plotted as function of depth in km both for a constant gravitational acceleration in blue, and for when $g$ is varying with depth in red.  
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/pressure.eps}
  \caption{Illustration of distribution of pressure on Europa with both a constant and varying gravitational acceleration in blue and red, respectively}
  \label{fig:Pressure}
\end{figure}
From figure \ref{fig:Pressure} it is seen that the pressure increases with depth which was expected. With a depth of 10 km it is seen that the pressure is approximately 12 MPa for both cases which is about 118 bars, where 1 bar is 101 kPa. 10 km is what the maximum depth of the ice-layer is and it is therefore crucial that the penetrator can withstand such a pressure. Furthermore it can be seen that using the varying gravitational acceleration we actually get a slightly higher pressure compared to a constant $g$ which is the opposite of what was expected. The varying gravitational acceleration is calculated as following: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:varygrav}
g = \frac{G \left(M - \frac{4}{3} \pi (r^3-(r-h)^3 \cdot \rho _{ice}\right)}{(r-h)^2}
\end{equation}
From \ref{eq:varygrav} it can be seen that the mass that is subtracted from the total mass of Europa is calculated using the density of ice. Since the density of ice is lower that the average density of Europa, which is:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{Europa} = \frac{M_{Europa}}{V_{Europa}} = \SI{2967}{\kg\per\m^3}
\end{equation}
we will get a lower decrease in gravitational acceleration than expected. If a submarine was to be launched from the penetrator to explore the ocean it would have to withstand a higher pressure than the penetrator if it should go deeper. It is unknown how deep the ocean is but sources expect up to 100 km thick water-layer. The pressure would at 110km depth be between 131 and 141 MPa depending on if a constant or varying gravitational acceleration is chosen where the density for water, $\rho_{water} = \SI{1000}{\kg\per\m^3}m$, is used. Europa is not a perfect sphere but rather closer to an ellipsoid and it is unknown how thick the ice-, water- and rock-layer of Europa are. Therefore the pressure is only a approximation that simplifies the geometry of Europa and hereby the calculations for the pressure. 


\section{RTG design}

\autsubsection{Radioactive Sources}{Jean-Paul Breuer}
A Radioisotope Thermal Generator (RTG), is essentially an nuclear battery that uses thermocouplers to convert the heat released by a selected radioactive source into electricity. Many radioactive sources exist which could serve the purpose of fuel for the RTG specific to this mission, but not all of the known radioactive isotopes would be efficient or viable for the task. There are three important characteristics to keep in mind when attempting to select the ideal radioactive isotopes.

An important criteria is the half-life time of the selected isotope. The minimum viable time is computed based on highly conservative estimates, where the main condition is that the isotope must still be able to provide sufficient energy for the instrumentation well after the coasting phase and the melting phase. Dependent on which rocket the mission is given, the coasting time could be anywhere between 2 and 8 years, and dependent on which landing site is chosen on the surface of Europa, the melting phase could take between 1 and 10 years (at a 200 day per km of ice melting rate). 

The amount of energy per time released is inversely proportional to its half life, so the ideal radioactive candidate will require a half life in the magnitude of several decades. To sit well within the mass, power, and volume budget, another criteria is that it must produce sufficiently large amount of power per mass and volume. The last criteria is that the type of radiation is easily absorbed and converted into thermal radiation, in other words, maximize the alpha particles released, and minimize the gamma, neutron, and penetrating radiation.

Given the three main criteria, it is possible to exclude many isotopes immediately, although the most likely candidates are given in Table \ref{tab:isotopes}. Other more known and available isotopes, such as Uranium, have a long half-life time and as such do not generate enough energy per time to be able to sufficiently provide the heat required for ice melting. On the other hand, an isotope with a short half life such as Polonium-210, has an extremely high power output but would require a large concentration to be of any use for this mission, and most of the energy would be wasted.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
		Candidate Isotopes & Half-Life & Power & Gamma, Neutron Level & Availability\\
		\hline
		Plutonium-238 & 87.7 years & $\sim$ 671 W/kg & Low & Low\\
		Strontium-90 & 28.8 years & $\sim$ 446 W/kg & Medium & High\\
		Americium-241 & 432 years & $\sim$ 135 W/kg & Low & High\\
		Polonium-210 & 138 days & $\sim$ 171269 W/kg & Low & Low\\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Table of radioactive sources that can be used for the RTG, half-life, power, and other information are given. \label{tab:isotopes}}
\end{table}

As can be seen from the table, Plutonium-238 and Americium-241 would seem like viable candidates for this mission; however, Americium requires further shielding due to it releasing gamma radiation along with the alpha particles. Strontium-90 is readily available as side products of nuclear reactors, but also requires heavy shielding due to the gamma particles, else it might damage the remainder of the electronics and instrumentation in the vicinity. Plutonium-238 is the ideal candidate, but is not currently found on Earth in sufficiently high quantities as it is only produced as a side product during enrichment for deployment in nuclear weapons. To get the materials in sufficiently high quantities, it would be required to reopen the nuclear facilities in Savannah River (USA), which would cost a significantly high amount of money and would also require a possibly annoying trudge through politics and policy.

\autsubsection{Radiation from Pu238}{Ricard Lladó Grove}\label{sec:plutonium}
After looking at the different materials, Plutonium-238 (Pu238) is the radioactive material that is going to be used for the mission due to the the half-life of 87.7, power production and the minimum radiation of gamma and neutrons. 

The probability of a alpha-decay from a Pu238-atom is close to 100\%: 
\begin{equation}
^{238}\text{Ph} \quad \rightarrow \quad ^{234}\text{U} \quad + \quad ^4 \text{He}
\end{equation}
The alpha particle is relatively big with two protons and two neutrons and is therefore easy to shield against, even a sheet of paper is enough to shield an alpha particle\cite{website:shielding}. Even if the possibility of an alpha decay is close to almost certain, there is a small possibility that the plutonium238 will either decay as spontaneous fission or a cluster decay\cite{website:plutonium}. A spontaneous fission happens for heavy atoms, where the atom split into two almost equal sized daughter atoms and a number of free neutrons\cite{website:spontaneous_fission}. The possibility of a spontaneous fission, SF, for Pu238 is $1.9 \cdot 10^{-7}\%$, but with more than $10^{24}$ atoms for each kg of plutonium, it is certain to happen. The daughter atoms generates by the SF can vary. A cluster decay is a decay mode between an alpha decay and spontaneous decay where a cluster of protons and neutrons are emitted. For the Pu238 there is a $1.4 \cdot 10^{-14}\%$ chance that a Si32-atom is emitted leaving a Hg206-atom, and a $6 \cdot 10^{-15}\%$ chance that a Mg30-atom and a Mg28-atom is emitted leaving an Yb180-atom. The daughter isotopes are also radioactive and are most likely to emit a beta-particle. This particle is either an electron or a positron depending on the charge of the particle with a mass much smaller than neutron or proton but since it has an electric charge it can rather easily be stop by a thin layer of a shielding metal. \\

\noindent
A bigger problem is the free neutrons that for example are emitted due to a spontaneous fission.  Neutrons do not have any electric charge and therefore they will not be stopped by an electric field making neutrons extremely penetrating. To stop a neutron it has to be absorbed by a nucleus or collide with a particle with same speed but opposite velocity and mass as the neutron. Since the materials used to shield alpha and beta particles, i.e. lead, has a rather small cross-section and few nuclei per unit mass, hence the neutron can easily pass trough the shielding. Furthermore if the neutron is absorbed in an atom it is possible that the created atom is radioactive as well. Therefore it is important to stop the neutrons, since they can cause a lot of damage if they hit the instruments on board the penetrator. In order to do so protium, a hydrogen atom with no neutron, can be used to absorb the neutron creating in deuterium. Water has a high number density to mass ratio, and is hereby optimal to use as a shielding against the free neutrons.

\autsubsection{Heat Generation}{Ricard Lladó Grove}\label{sec:HeatGeneration}
After looking at the radiation from a Plutonium atom it was shown that the probability of an alpha decay is extremely high. Therefore it will in the following when calculating the energy outcome from a radiative decay be assumed that plutonium only radiates as an alpha decay. If a more precise result has to be achieved it is necessary to include the other modes of decay and also the whole decay chain since if Pu238 emits an alpha particle U234 is produced. This isotope is also radioactive even though its lifetime is 2.400 years which means that the thermal energy generated is much lower for U234. It is first after 12 decays that the decay chain ends with the stable isotope of lead: Pb206\cite{website:plutonium}. To calculate how much energy one alpha decay will produce, the energy equation derived from Einstein is used:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
\text{$E_{atom}$} & ={} mc^2 \\
& = (m_{Pu238} - [m_{U234} + m_{He4}]) \cdot c^2 \\
& = (238.049559894U - [234.040952088U + 4.00150646649U])\\
& \cdot 1.66053904020\cdot 10^{-27}\text{kg} \cdot 2.99\cdot 10^8 \text{m/s}\\
& = 1.06\cdot 10^{-12} J 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Since the mass of Pu238 is higher than the total mass of U234 and He4 energy will be released when the decay occurs. When knowing how much one decay will produce of thermal energy, the number of decays in a radioactive material can be calculated as following\cite{website:decay}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:halflife}
A = A_0 \cdot 2^{\frac{t}{\tau}}
\end{equation}
where \textit{$A_0$} is the initial number of atoms in a lump of a radioactive material, \textit{A} is the atoms left in the material after a specific time, \textit{t}, with a half-life of  \textit{$\tau$}. The energy produced by 1 kg of Pu238 over a timespan of one second will then be: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
\text{$E_{kg}$} & ={} E_{atom} \cdot [A_0 - A] \\
& = E_{atom} \cdot \left[A_0 - A_0 \cdot 2^{\frac{t}{\tau}}\right] \\
& = E_{atom}  \cdot \left[\frac{1}{m_{Pu238}} - \frac{2^{\frac{t}{\tau}}}{m_{Pu238}} \right] \\
& = 671 J
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We here see that for each kg of Pu238, 671W energy is generated in form of thermal energy.  \\

\noindent
Plutonium is normally not used in its pure form. Normally it is processed into the chemical plutonium dioxide, PuO2 \cite{website:plutoniumoxide}. This ceramic is more stable and in case of an accident at launch or re-entry pure plutonium would be scattered into small pieces on a large area under the accident where PuO2 would more or less stay as one big lump which would make it easy to clean up and prevent a radioactive release. Furthermore the melting temperature is $2.660^oC$ and has a low solubility in water, meaning that it does not easily dissolve in water. When using plutonium dioxide compared to pure plutonium the power produced per kg will also decrease. Pu238 weights about 238 atomic units and oxygen weights about 16 atomic units. By calculating the percentage of oxygen compared to plutonium an estimate of the power per mass can be found: 
\begin{equation*}
\text{Percentage Plutonium in PuO2} = \frac{p_{Pu} - p_{O2}}{p_{Pu}}\cdot 100\% = \frac{238 - 32}{238}\cdot 100\% = 86.5\% 
\end{equation*}
Hereby the heat production is reduced from 671 J to $671J \cdot 0.865 = 580J$. The thermal energy production stated here is only valid for the first second. Since it takes between two and seven years to reach Europa some of the plutonium oxide will have decayed and hereby the energy production will have decreased. As always the worst case scenario will be chosen where the maximum time of arrival to Europa is seven years assuming that SLS is not ready when the mission has to launch and that the sling shot effect where gravity of the planets are used to increase the velocity is not used. Hereby the decrease of atoms of plutonium can be calculated from equation \ref{eq:halflife}: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{A}{A_0} = 2^{\frac{t}{\tau}} = 2^{\frac{7}{87.7}} = 0.946
\end{equation}
where  $t$ and $\tau$ are both measured in years. We see that with a half-life of 87.7 years there will after 7 years be 94.6\% of the brought plutonium is left. Hereby each kg of plutonium oxide will produce $580J \cdot 0.946 = 548.7J$ after 7 years which is the time where the RTG will be used to melt though the ice.

\autsubsection{Shielding}{Ricard Lladó Grove} \label{sec:shielding}
As mentioned a typical shielding material is lead,for this case zirconium would be a better choice, first of all because it has a melting temperature that is three times higher than lead, and second of all because the material is lighter. It is still not possible to stop the free neutrons, where we instead will use water. First the Plutonium will be surrounded by the zirconium, afterwards a layer of water and in the end some thermocouplers will generate electricity from the heat

\autsubsection{Thermal Design of RTG}{Ricard Lladó Grove}\label{sec:ThermalDesign}
The RTG will be used both as the electric generator and the thermal energy generator to melt through the ice. Here it is assumed that the electric power needed is about 150W and that the needed thermal energy required for melting is 2kW in order to get sufficient energy for melting through the ice at the desired rate at 100 days per kilometre. Hereby it is needed to produce 7.5\% extra thermal energy to produce the electrical energy. The energy will be generated by thermocouples which can create a voltage when a temperature difference between two metals that are connected by a wire. The thermocouples will be discussed later in section \ref{sec:thermocouples}. \\

\noindent
As mentioned each kg of plutonium oxide will produce about 548J each each second and 2.15kW is needed. This means that the total amount of PuO2 is: 
\begin{equation}
m_{PuO2} = \frac{2150W}{548 \frac{W}{kg}} = 3.92 kg \approx 4 kg 
\end{equation}
Hereby with 4 kg of plutonium dioxide sufficient energy is produced to melt through the ice. With a density of $\rho_{PuO2} = \SI{11.46}{\g\per\cm^3}$\cite{golovnin2001a} the total volume needed can be calculated for the plutonium rod by $V = \frac{m}{\rho_{PuO2}} \approx \SI{0.34}{litres}$. Before calculating the radius of the rod consisting of plutonium oxide there has to be space to holes across the PuO2 where water can flow trough to get heated. An illustration of the design is shown in figure \ref{fig:RTGcenter}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/RTG3.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the design of the plutonium dioxide with a height of 30cm and a radius of 1.96cm}
  \label{fig:RTGcenter}
\end{figure}
Here the PuO2 is shown with 20 small cylindrical holes with a radius of 1 mm. Many small holes are made to get a large area where the water floes close to the PuO2 so it will be heated up more efficiently. Each hole will have a volume of: $V = \pi r^2 h$. Since the 20 holes goes through the PuO2 the volume of them will be added to the volume of RTG in order to calculate the radius of the PuO2. In this way the right volume will be calculated for the PuO2 when calculating the radius. It can be seen that with a height of 30 cm the radius of the rod will be 1.96cm.  A cylindrical rod has been chosen as the design for the radioactive material. As explained earlier a large area is wanted where water is flowing close to the RTG only separated by zirconium that is used as shielding from the radioactivity. With a elongated design of PuO2 it is possible to heat up the water more the same flow than if a square of PuO2 was chosen. Since the penetrator is cylindrical this shape is optimal for the PuO2 as well. 

\subsubsection{System design of the RTG} 
In the following simplifies calculations will give an approximation of the heat transferred when the water passes through the plutonium oxide while getting heated and when the water delivers its thermal energy to the surroundings. In figure \ref{fig:RTGsystem} the design of the flow of water is illustrated. In the middle the heat is generated by the PuO2 with the structure illustrated in figure \ref{fig:RTGcenter}. Water is pumped through the 20 small holes inside of the PuO2 and furthermore water will surround the PuO2 with an outer radius about 1.2 wider than the radius of the PuO2 corresponding to about 4 mm. When the water has passed the PuO2 it will be divided into 6 pipes with a manifold. The pipes will start in the middle of the penetrator and spread out to the inner shell of the penetrator so the same distance between each of the pipes are achieved. When the hot water flows in the pipes they will transfer the heat to the penetrator shell that will transfer the heat to the ice on the other side of the shell. When the temperature of the water has decreased to the same amount as before heated they will as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:RTGsystem} go back to the PuO2 where the water will be slightly heated. Here we will have a temperature difference due to the hot water on one side and the cold water on the other which makes it an ideal place to but thermocouples to produce thermal energy which will be discussed later in section \ref{sec:thermocouples}. The slightly heated water will be used to keep the top of the penetrator hot enough not to freeze in, where it afterwards returns to the pump and restarts the cycle. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/RTG-system.png}
  \caption{System design of the heat transportation with water flowing in the pipes}
  \label{fig:RTGsystem}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Heating of water}
First of all it is possible to calculate how much the water surrounding the PuO2 will be heated up. In order to calculate the heating of the water following assumption is made: all the energy for the melting from the PuO2 will be absorbed by the water. This is a valid assumption because if the energy is not absorbed it will be stored in the PuO2 which increases the temperature of PuO2. When the temperature increases more of the heat generated will be transferred because the temperature difference will be increase. Hereby when the PuO2 has reached a certain temperature there will be an equilibrium where all the energy is absorbed by the water. The energy that the thermocouples uses in order to create electric energy is subtracted from this heating as well.
The flow of the water in units of $\text{[kg/s]}$ can be calculated as: 
\begin{equation}
f = A_{cross} \cdot v \cdot \rho
\end{equation}
where $A_{cross}$ is the cross-sectional area of the water pipes and water surrounding the PuO2, $v$ is the velocity of the water which is the variable that can be changed in order to get a decrease or increase of the change in water temperature and $\rho_{water}$ is the density of water. The cross-sectional area can be calculated since all the parameters are known: 
\begin{equation}
A_{cross} = \left(r_{holes}^2 \cdot n + \left(1.2r_{PuO2}-r_{PuO2}\right) ^2 \right) \cdot \pi = 0.11 \cdot 10^{-3} m^2
\end{equation}
where n is the number of holes in the PuO2, $r_{holes}$ is the radius of the holes and $r_{PuO2}$ is the radius of the PuO2-rod.  The specific heat capacity of water is $C_p = \SI{4219}{\J\per\kg\per\K}$ when the water is 100$^o$C \cite{website:water_dens}, which means that 1 kg of water needs 4219 J to increase the temperature with 1 Kelvin. If multiplying the water flow and the specific heat capacity of water it is possible to calculate how much energy is transferred to the water for each Kelvin, and for this case if the flow velocity is set to $\SI{0.03}{\m\per\s}$ in order to get a comfortable heating of the water: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:waterheating}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Power per degree} & ={} f \cdot C_p \\
& = A_{cross} \cdot v \cdot \rho \cdot C_p \\
& = 0.11\cdot 10^{-3} m^2 \cdot \SI{0.03}{\m\per\s} \cdot \SI{1000}{\kg\m^{-3}} \cdot \SI{4219}{\J\per\kg\per\K} \\
& = \SI{14.05} {\W\per\K} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This means that for each Kelvin the temperature will increase, 14.05 W is needed Since the thermal energy for the melting is 2kW the temperature changes will be: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:waterheating2}
\Delta T = \frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Power per degree}} = \frac{2kW}{\SI{14.05} {\W\per\K} } = \SI{142}{K}
\end{equation}
So with a velocity of 0.03 m/s which corresponds to the water flows past the PuO2 for 10 seconds since the height is 0.3 m, the temperature will have increased with 142 Kelvin. In this calculation it is also assumed that waters specific heat capacity is independent of the temperature which is not the case but the changes are negligible. Since water is used to transfer the heat, the water would boil if the temperature was to reach more than $100^oC$ as normal pressures, so to be able to heat up the water further, it has to be under a higher pressure. If the pressure inside the pipe system is 50 bar, or around 5 MPa, the water has a boiling temperature at $264^\circ$C. The velocity of the water can be decreased even further but with a 142$^o$C increase of temperature there is a good margin before the water begins to boil if assuming that the water is close to freezing point when entering the PuO2 region. If the water starts to boil the pressure will increase, the flow of the water will be decrease and a higher degree of corrosion could happen which all would be critical to the penetrator. \\

\noindent
The flow-rate of the water will with a velocity of 0.03 m/s and an area of $0.11\cdot 10^{-3} m^2$ be 3.3 g/s or 12 litre per hour. With is a really low flow-rate. Furthermore the gravitational acceleration is almost one tenth of the one at Earth's surface and therefore less pumping power is needed. Therefore a customized pump system can be made that uses really low power an really small mass. 


\subsubsection{Cooling of water}
After the heating of the water it has to be deliver the heat to the surroundings. A manifold is a connection between a big pipe and several smaller pipes. In this case a manifold will be dividing the bigger pipe where water has just been heated into 6 smaller pipes. Any number can be chosen as long as the total water flow is the same in the whole water system. If more pipes are wanted the smaller should they be as long as there is symmetry so one side of the penetrator is not heated up more than the other. When the water flows in the pipes they will dissipate heat to the surroundings. Here it is assumed that the water will dissipate its heat only by convective heat transfer which is transfer of heat due to movements of fluid. The basic relation for convective heat transfer is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:convectiveheat}
q = h \cdot A \cdot (T_a - T_b)
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the heat transferred which in this case will be all the heat that the water has absorbed from the PuO2 i.e. 2kW, $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient which for forced convection with a moderate flow of water in a pipe is about $\SI{3000}{\W\per\m^2\per\K}$\cite{website:waterconvection}, $A$ is the area of which the water is in contact with the surroundings, $T_a$ is the temperature of the surrounding of the water and $T_b$ is the temperature of the water. The temperature difference between the surroundings and the water can be defined as $\Delta T$. Looking at equation \ref{eq:convectiveheat}, $\Delta T$ is linear proportional to the heat transferred meaning that the higher temperature difference the more energy is transferred. Because of the linearity the average dissipation of energy can be calculated by using the average temperature difference between the surroundings and the water Assuming that the water will have dissipated all the heat that was absorbed when heated before it crosses the thermocouples it is possible to calculate how long the pipe has to be since the average temperature difference will be half of the increase in temperature when the water was heated: $\Delta T_{avg} = \Delta T_{heated} / 2 = 71^o$K. With 6 pipes a diameter of the pipes are chosen to be $1/20$th of the RTG's circumference, which is 6.2mm.
The area of which is the pipe is in contact with the cold surroundings will be the circumference multiplied with the length of the pipe system. This is only valid if assuming that the material surrounding the water are able to transport the heat to the shell of the penetrator that will dissipate its thermal energy to the ice. With the mentioned approximations the length needed to dissipate the heat can be calculated by isolating the length in equation \ref{eq:convectiveheat}:
\begin{equation}
L_{pipe} = \frac{q}{h\cdot D_{pipe} \cdot \pi \cdot \Delta T_{avg} \cdot n} = \frac{2kW}{\SI{3000}{\W\per\m^2\per\K} \cdot \SI{0.0062}{m} \cdot \pi \cdot \SI{71}{K} \cdot 6} = \SI{0.08}{m}
\end{equation}
A length of 8cm is needed in order to dissipate the 2kW using an average temperature approximation. The question is how useful this approximation of the heat dissipation is, since one would think that the last part of the length of the pipe the temperature difference is much smaller than the beginning of the pipe and hence the cooling of the water would be non-linear. Therefore a more mathematical method has been used to estimate the heat dissipation where the flow rate of the water was taken into account to calculate the temperature distribution of the water along the whole length of the pipe. In order to do so a modification of equation \ref{eq:waterheating} and \ref{eq:waterheating2} are being used where the volume of the water times the densty of water are used instead of the flowrate. Hereby the temperature change can be calculated. The derivative of the temperature change will hereby be the change in temperature per second and the heat dissipated per second is given by equation \ref{eq:convectiveheat}. Reducing give following expression:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dT}{dt} & =  \quad {} \frac{q}{V\rho C_p} \quad = \quad \frac{hA\Delta T}{V\rho C_p}  \\
& = \quad\frac{hA_{circ} dx \Delta T}{A_{cross} dx \rho C_p}\quad =\quad \frac{hA_{circ} \Delta T}{A_{cross} \rho C_p} \\
& =\quad \frac{2\pi r}{\pi r^2} \frac{h\Delta T}{\rho C_p} \quad=\quad \frac{2}{r} \frac{h\Delta T}{\rho C_p} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $V$ is volume and $v$ is the speed of the water. We end up with a differential equation that easily can be solved both as a function of time and as a function of length of the pipe, since $t = x/v$: 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
T(t) =  T_0 + exp\left[-\frac{2ht}{r\rho C_p}\right]\cdot \Delta T
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdiff}
T(x) =  T_0 + exp\left[-\frac{2hx}{r\rho C_p v}\right]\cdot \Delta T
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Since the flow-rate of the water is know the velocity of the water can be calculating by isolating it in $f = A_{cross}\cdot v \cdot \rho \cdot n$, where n is the number of pipes, since the total amount of water will be divided equally in all the pipes. Illustrated in figure \ref{fig:watercool} the temperature difference between the outside and the water has ben plotted as function of the length of the pipe. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/watercooling.eps}
  \caption{The temperature difference as function of length of the pipe}
  \label{fig:watercool}
\end{figure}
It can from equation \ref{eq:tdiff} and figure \ref{fig:watercool} be seen that the temperature will not decrease linearly but exponentially. Additionally it can also be seen that the linear approximation estimated 8 cm length before all heat was dissipated, but with the differential method a length of 25 cm was achieved, where more than 90\% of the heat will be dissipated the first 10 cm which seems to be a more legit pipe length. For both cases it is assumed that the heat that is transferred into the penetrator shell from the hot water will have the same dissipation rate so an equilibrium temperature is achieved. The optimum would be a very good heat conductor as penetrator shell so the heat quickly will be transferred to the ice and a low temperature of the shell is acquired, which also has been discussed earlier. The same consideration should also be made of the material of the heat pipes which would also be most efficient if it had a high heat conductivity. \\

\noindent 
In the following an estimate of the mass budget of the pipes are calculated. In order to do so equation \ref{eq:pressure} is used to get an estimate of how thick the pipes need to be in order to be strong enough to withstand the inner pressure of 50 bar from the water. In order to get a conservative estimate the factor of safety is 2 and the outer pressure is so to zero. Using inconel

\subsubsection{Future work}
With 25 cm the pipes will as illustrated at figure \ref{fig:RTGsystem} go to the inner radius of the penetrator along the bottom, hereafter it will follow the penetrator about 10 cm and hereafter go back to the outside of the RTG where the cold water will be used to get a high temperature difference between the hot water surrounding the RTG which will be used to generate electric energy. The cold water will be heated by the temperature difference and be transported further up through the penetrator to keep it from freezing and return to RTG afterwards. No following calculations of the top part of the heat pipe system will be discussed since much more complex calculations are needed in order to get more accurate values which has to be considered when the final design of the penetrator will be done. Another consideration is that the top of the penetrator will have small RTG's in the beginning due to the relay system. The heat generated from the small RTG's can be used to keep the top of the penetrator from freezing until they are deployed. This also leads to another consideration that has not been discussed for the thermal design of the penetrator, namely that the ice temperature will change with depth. Since the ice in near the surface has a lower temperature than the ice close to the water, more heat has to be used to avoid that the whole penetrator will freeze in. This is fortunate since the relay systems with the small RTG will only be deployed after a certain depth. On the other hand if the ice layer is much thinner than expected the relay systems will not be deployed and which would create problems for the anchoring system.\\
 
\noindent
All the calculations for the thermal design are only preliminary and it has to be elaborated and expanded in order to calculate the real heat flow. There are though many possibilities to change small parameters in the design in order to customize the heat transportation if the assumptions made in this section shows to be too simple. For example the flow rate could be changed, or the radius of the pipes where the penetrator shell will be heated or maybe change the number of pipes. All in all further testing and experimenting with the thermal design in order to validate the system. 

\autsubsection{Generation of electric energy}{Ricard Grove} \label{sec:thermocouples}
As mentioned thermocouples will be used to directly generate electric energy from thermal energy. A current will be created when having a temperature difference between two different thermoelectric materials when they are joined in their ends. The higher the temperature difference the more power will be generated. In this case a tested model of thermocouple are going to be used as reference to the calculations taken from \cite{lau1997a}. A module of 127 couples with dimensions $1.4mm\times 1.4mm\times 1.15mm$ has been tested with the result illustrated in figure \ref{fig:thermocouple}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/thermocouples.png}
  \caption{Graph illustrating the power produced as function of temperature of the hot side, where the cold side is 300K}
  \label{fig:thermocouple}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
It can from figure \ref{fig:thermocouple} be seen that the the higher temperature difference the more power will be produced which was also the expected. Three different models are used to calculate the power output, where $P_{fea}$ was the most accurate but produced the least power. In our case the maximum temperature difference will be around 140K and at this difference there are almost no difference between the three modes. At this temperature difference each model with 127 pellets will produce around 7-8 W. To get 150 W the number of pellets necessary will be around 2700 pellets where the dimensions was $1.4\text{mm}\times 1.4\text{mm}\times 1.15\text{mm}$. An approximation of how big an area the pellets will take can be calculated by multipling the width and length of one pellet with the total amount of pellets needed. Hereafter it can be compare to the circumference of the water that surrounds the PuO2. Since the outer radius of the water column was designed to be $1.2\cdot r_{rtg}$ the circumference can be calculated. In this case the two ends of the cylinder of the water surrounding the PuO2 will not be taken into account but only the circumference of the tube. 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
A_{pellet} = \frac{P_{total}}{P_{pellet}} \cdot \text{width} \cdot \text{length} = \frac{150W}{\frac{7W}{127}}\cdot \SI{0.0014}{m}\cdot \SI{0.0014}{m} = \SI{0.0053}{\m^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
A_{PuO2} = 2\pi\cdot 1.2r_{PuO2} h_{PuO2} = 2\pi\cdot \SI{0.0196}{\m} \cdot \SI{0.3}{m} = \SI{0.0443}{\m^2}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Hereby we see that the area needed to produce 150W easily can fit into on the circumference of the water surrounding the PuO2.

 Take into account that it is not the hole circumference of the water that has heat pipes on the other side. 
 
In this case the efficiency of the thermocouples does not matter that much since all the thermal energy that are not converted to electrical energy will be used to warm up the water. The thermal energy that is not used to create electric energy will go to loses in the thermocouple and mostly in heating of the components. Hereby we will get a slightly different distribution of energy. 


\autsubsection{Heat pipes}{Ricard Grove}\label{sec:heatpipes}
To distribute the heat that is generated from the plutonium. In order to do so, the water will be under high pressure.  This will give some advantages for the system in the sense that it is almost impossible to maintain a temperature below $100^\circ$C which is waters normal boiling point, when transporting 2kW of heat.\\

\noindent
The pipe system will consist of pipes surrounding the RTG in the bottom and middle of the penetrator. Since the RTG is 30 cm long the pipes will be this as well with 18 tubes cut in half. The water will then flow out to the 18 tubes in the outer part of the RTG. Since most of the heat of generated should be directed downwards 12 of the tubes only cover the lowest $1/4$ of the penetrator. The other 6 tubes will go all the way to the top of the penetrator in order to ensure that the penetrator will not freeze in because the top of the penetrator is too cold. With an internal pressure of 5MPa, the thickness of the tubes that have water in them will be around 1 mm depending on the material if the other radius of the tubes are 1.48 cm. The heat pipe system will then weight around 6 kg. Furthermore the system will take up 6.5 liters of space.

\section{Selected Design}

\subsection{Melting through the ice} % Lukas, KSL

\autsubsection{RTG Placement}{Jean-Paul Breuer and Ricard Lladó Grove}
The obvious choice for the placement of the RTG within the penetrator would be near the bottom. As the melting mechanism requires going down, having the RTG near the tip would reduce heat loss, maximizing the melting potential of the penetrator, as well as move the center of gravity of the RTG to a more stable position relative to the movement direction. During descent, this lower point of gravity would help with the dirigibility, as the penetrator would be less likely to tip over to one side.

To simply mention as an alternative, there are also pros and cons to having the RTG be placed at the top of the penetrator. Assuming that the RTG is at the top, the instrument suite would be located near the bottom of the penetrator, so it might be already possible to take samples and filter the ice within the column while descending. Once anchored at the bottom of the ice column, having the instrument suite on the bottom of the penetrator would be beneficial in that it would be possible to just dip the tip into the water and have the instrument suite work as intended. Problems with placing the RTG near the top would be the requirement of further and more efficient heat pipes to channel the heat down towards the tip, which would also cause further problems with the instrument suite, as the heat would also have an effect on the instrumentation. It would also cause problems with dirigibility as it would be more probable to fall over to one side, and ultimately end up sideways as a worst case alternative.

\sigma = \frac{-2 P_{ext}\cdot r_{outer}^2}{r_{outer}^2-r_{inner}^2}/ + \frac{P_{int}\cdot (r_{outer}^2+r_{inner}^2)}{(r_{outer}^2-r_{inner}^2)}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the stress on the material, $P_{ext}$ and $P_{int}$ is the external and internal pressure, $r_{outer}$ and $r_{inner}$ is the outer and inner radius. 


\section{Anchor Design}
\autsubsection{Buoyancy}{Ricard Lladó Grove}
One way to anchor the penetrator is through buoyancy. In general buoyancy is an upward force that is exerted to an object by the surrounded fluid. For an object immersed in a fluid, the force acting on the object is gravity and buoyancy given by:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bouyancy1}
F_{gravity} = m_{object} \cdot g
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bouyancy2}
F_{buoyancy} = \rho_{fluid}\cdot g \cdot V_{immersed} 
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $\rho$ is density, $V$ is volume of the immersed part of the object and $m$ is mass.  In our case the object is the penetrator and the fluid that the penetrator is immersed into is assumed to be pure water. In order to use buoyancy as the anchor of the penetrator, it has to cancel out the force of the gravity that will pull the penetrator downwards i.e make it sink. We can hereby equal equation \ref{eq:bouyancy1} and \ref{eq:bouyancy2}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:bou1}
F_{gravity} = F_{buoyancy} \quad \rightarrow \quad m_{penetrator}\cdot g_{Europa} = \rho_{fluid}\cdot g_{Europa} \cdot V_{immersed}   \quad \rightarrow 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bou2}
V_{immersed} = \frac{m_{penetrator}}{\rho_{fluid}}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
First of all we see that the gravitational acceleration of Europa cancels out in both equations, which simplifies the expression. It is desired to calculate the volume that is needed in order to the force of the buoyancy to be great enough to lift the mass of the penetrator hence cancel out the gravity. The mass of the penetrator is in our mission straw man set to be maximum 180 kg even though it is only an assumption  If the mass of the penetrator shows to actually be lower than expected a lower volume would be needed. The density of the water is set to 1000 $\frac{m^3}{kg}$ which is the density of pure water. It is not known how salty the water if it contains salt, but the density of salt water is slightly higher then water without salt, and hereby the buoyancy force would be higher and a smaller volume is needed, so by using pure water we get a conservative value of the volume. By inserting the value we end up with the volume needed to carry the penetrator in pure water:
\begin{equation}
V_{needed} = 0.180 m^3 \rightarrow 180 \text{litres}
\end{equation}
Since the penetrator is 48.2 litres the extra required volume is about 132 litres. There are many ways to use buoyancy. Submarines have a ballast tank that they can fill with either water or oil. Since oil is about 0.8 times as dense as water this will create a buoyancy and depending on how much water is displaced. This solution is not useful for this penetrator since a huge reservoir of oil is needed which would take up more space and mass than is to dispersal. Another solution is to have an inflatable reservoir that will expand when the internal pressure increases. An illustration of such a solution is showed in figure \ref{fig:bouyancy1}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/Buoyancy1.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the immersed penetrator with the inflated balloon to reach equilibrium between the buoyancy force and the gravitational force}
  \label{fig:buoyancy1}
\end{figure}
When the penetrator melts through the last ice the velocity of the penetrator will increase because the it will sink though the water. With a short delay to ensure that the penetrator is surrounded by water, a trigger should inflate a balloon attached to the penetrator. The balloon should have a volume of at least 132 litres since we would probably like a small lift of the buoyancy. The most suitable place for the balloon to be inflated is above the penetrator since the balloon will have the uplift required to cancel out the effect of gravity. Hereby this will be the most stable situation even though it will complicate the communication to the lander since the antenna should be above the balloon. This is doable but not the most desired solution. In this case a volume of 132 litres should be obtained when having the same internal and external pressure. One way to obtain this is by having a pressure vessel with a huge internal pressure. If the volume of the penetrator is 10 litres the pressure inside the vessel should be 13.2 times bigger than the external pressure which is 12MPa in 10 km depth. Hereby an internal pressure of more than 160MPa is needed in the pressure vessel. In this way when the pressure of the pressure vessel is released into the balloon it would expand 13.2 times which is 132 litres. The problem with this solution is that a pressure vessel that can withstand such a pressure has to be relatively big and hereby also heavy. As an example the equation \ref{eq:pressure} can be used to calculate the properties of such a strong pressure vessel.  if using titanium as the pressure vessel and assuming that the vessel is a sphere which is the strongest structure to withstand pressure, the radius would be 9.5 cm and the thickness had to be about 4 cm to withstand the 160MPa internal pressure, which would mean a mass of about 30 kg. This will make the buoyancy anchoring disadvantageous against other anchoring methods. \\

Another way to inflate the balloon is by having a chemical reaction that will produce a quantity of gas.


\noindent 
Even though it is disadvantageous it would be good to see if the buoyancy is even possible for these high pressures since almost all gases are liquid or even solid at these high pressures. Since a liquid is almost incompressible it can be compressed to the desired pressure without taking much space. The problem is then that when released the pressure has to be low enough for the liquid to evaporate. To give an example the gas CO2 can be selected. The Phase diagram of CO2 is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:CO2phase}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Ricardo/co2_phase_diagram}\caption{Phase diagram of CO2. From: \url{http://www.chemicalogic.com/Documents/co2_phase_diagram.pdf}}
\label{fig:CO2phase}
\end{figure}
With the balloon above the penetrator, it will be surrounded by water that has a temperature close to the freezing point and hereby the temperature of the gas would be almost the same as the temperature of the surrounding water which is around 273 K, corresponding to $0^oC$. In figure \ref{fig:CO2phase} the vaporization point corresponding to this temperature is 35 bar. Since we have to assume the worst case scenario the depth of the ice could be up to 10 km deep, the pressure is approximately 120 bar. This is a huge problem since CO2 at this pressure hereby would not evaporate from the liquid pressure vessel. One solution is to increase the temperature. The critical point for CO2 is about $30^oC$ where the pressure is just above 70 bar. In principle this means that CO2 cannot be  used for a depth of 10 km. This means that another gas has to be used in order to make buoyancy work at this pressure. For water the phase diagram is illustrated earlier we see that at temperatures around 600 Kelvin the vaporization point is about 120 bar. A possible solution these high temperatures would be to have the balloon surrounding the penetrator and use the heat produced by the RTG to warm up the gas. This would produce problems since the density of the gas would be less than the density of the penetrator and hereby in worst case scenario the penetrator would tilt or flip and all communication would be lost. Furthermore the heating of the gas would last for relatively long time and hereby the penetrator would have sunken before the force of the buoyancy would be great enough to lift the penetrator. Therefore the solution with a heated gas would not work in practice especially not if a temperature of 600 Kelvin is needed.\\
 
\noindent
Assuming that the ice layer is only two kilometres deep the pressure would be around 34 bar which is just below the vaporization point for CO2 at $0^oC$. To get an estimate of how much CO2 is needed if assuming that the penetrator should be anchored at 2 km depth, the the ideal gas law can be used, which is given by equation \ref{eq:idealgaslaw}. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:idealgaslaw}
PV = nRT
\end{equation}
where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is how many moles is in the gas, $R$ is the ideal gas constant and T is temperature. Since CO2 weights 44 gram per mole it is possible to calculate the mass for 132 litres of CO2: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:massCO2}
m_{CO2} = \frac{M_{CO2} \cdot P_{water}\cdot V_{balloon}}{R\cdot T_{water}} = \frac{44 \frac{g}{mole} \cdot 35 bar \cdot 132 L}{0.0831  \frac{L\cdot bar}{mole \cdot K} \cdot 273K} = 882.8 g
\end{equation}
From equation \ref{eq:massCO2} it is seen that only 0.882 kg CO2 is needed with a pressure of 35 bar, but if the pressure would increase to 120 more CO2 is needed in order to withstand the higher pressure. The ideal gas law should be used with very much care since at these high pressures and it can be discussed whether the result from equation \ref{eq:massCO2} is even useful. Experiments are needed in order to get a more realistic mass needed. If assuming that the buoyancy would work at 2 km depth there are still more things to take into accoutn. First of all there is the material of the balloon. It has to be a really strong material since some of the balloon will be in contact with the ice which will scratch the material. Depending on how pointy the ice will be, it can make a hole in the balloon which will be a mission killer since the the buoyancy force will be lost and the penetrator will sink. If the penetrator sinks it cannot withstand the high pressure and furthermore the communication will also be lost. Besides being really strong the material has to be flexible because it should fill the least space as possible when not inflated, but be able to expand when the pressure inside it expands. Another problem that has to be taken into account is that if the communication should not be lost is that the current that run in Europa's ocean will make the penetrator drift. If it drifts the probability of losing communication would be really high since a directive antenna is used.  Therefore some kind of hook has to be attached to the ice to fix the position of the penetrator. All the problems that arise if using a buoyancy anchor will not be discussed further since buoyancy will not be used as anchor, but if the ice profile were known better and a spot with only 2 km depth were found the buoyancy using CO2 as gas could be used, where the mentioned problems would have to be considered. \\

\autsubsection{Detection of Depth and End of Ice Column}{Jean-Paul Breuer}
There is now a method for both navigating and making corrections to the penetrator orientation in the ice column, but now it brings the question of how the penetrator will be able to navigate and avoid rocks or obstacles if there is no way to see anything. More importantly, there has to be a reliable method for determining the end of the ice column, otherwise the final anchoring mechanism may not deploy properly, might deploy at an inconvenient location, or perhaps could completely miss the target and get lost in the subsurface ocean. Mission failure at this point would be a horrific tragedy, not only because of the money spent to put everything together and the headaches taken to acquire the Plutonium-238, but also because of the time investment that it would take to get so far through the ice just to lose everything at the most critical point.

Fortunately, there is an elegant solution to this problem. By implementing an echo-sounder receiver near the tip of the penetrator and utilizing some Geophysical methods, it should be possible to obtain a rough image of the ice based on the returned echoes from the different ice layers. 



%\section{Communication Systems}

%\subsection{Communication to Lander}

\autsubsection{Relay Systems}{Jean-Paul Breuer}
As the Penetrator makes its descent along the ice column, dependent on the chosen landing site and the total depth of the ice, there may be a requirement for several communication relays to send and receive the data from the instrument suite at the bottom of the ice column to the lander near the surface. With regards to the design of the communication relay system, the most ideal configuration would be to keep the $n$ number of relays required positioned near the top of the Penetrator as several cylindrical, detachable sections. Once reaching the appropriate depth, an anchoring mechanism should activate to capture and maintain the relay at that depth, while the remainder of the Penetrator continues it's descent.

Naturally, each of these relay systems will need to be self sustaining, requiring a power source, and perhaps also a hard disk as a failsafe to serve as intermediary storage of the data in case anything unforeseen happens. In regards to a power source, it would be most efficient to use small RTGs with an isotope that has sufficient energy output to power the relay and has a sufficiently long half life that wont require as much mass. Checking Table \ref{tab:isotopes}, Americium-241 would be a reasonable solution, since it has a fairly high availability (cheap), and has a decent half life and power output.

For anchoring, the easiest mechanism would require explosive bolts which would shoot out in several directions into the ice and secure the relay in the correct position and orientation. After several days, the water ice will refreeze over the relay and by then anchoring will have served its purpose. One other consideration for anchoring the relays was to excrete salt or some other chemical compound that might help expedite the freezing process. A `cryo-grenade' that could shock freeze the relays into place or even the expanding foam could also serve for a similar purpose.

In regards to communication, the best solution would involve having a patch antenna on both the bottom and top of the cylinder, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:comms_relay}. Although, for a more powerful transmission it might also be possible to use a helical antenna instead. In the case of the helical antenna, the anchoring mechanism would require additional springs which would uncoil the antennas and secure the relay until being frozen over once more.
