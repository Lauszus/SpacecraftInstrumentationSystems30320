\chapter{Acknowledgements}
On behalf of the whole Spacecraft instrumentation team we would like to thank John Leif JÃ¸rgensen for the great lectures and as the perfect team leader for the Europa mission, excelling the mission to a whole other level. We would also like to thank the JPL-crew which feedback and presence meant a lot for the whole team, giving the whole mission a taste of reality.
Further more the team would like to give a special thank to one colleague, Kristian Sloth Lauszus, for being the main editor of the whole book. With out him, orchestrating all the individual contributions, this book would never have become what it is today.  

Enjoy!
