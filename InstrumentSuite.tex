\autsection{Sample up-concentration \& injection}{Morten Lykke Hilligsøe}\label{sec:water_flow}
Although the instruments selected for the mission have high detection rates, up-concentration of the surrounding waters will enable the detection and quantification of low concentration compounds. To do this, the surrounding water is passed through a ceramic nano filter, which retains any microbes such as bacteria and viruses, as well as most particles. The filter was originally developed in collaboration with NASA, for use in water recycling systems on space missions. After running the surrounding water through this filter for an extended period of time, the water flow is reversed and directed to the instrument suite. When reversing the water flow, the particles on the surface of the filter will be extracted relatively quickly, thereby resulting in an up concentrated sample liquid.

In order to reverse the water flow, a pump is needed. Peristaltic pumps are mechanically very simple and reliable, and therefore suitable for space missions. However the HPLC system described in section \ref{sec:hplc}, requires a pump operating at pressures outside the range of most peristaltic pumps. In order to combine the two pumps of the filtration system and HPLC system, a single high pressure pump \cite{hplc_motor} is used. The suggested high pressure pump has a maximum flow rate of 40ml/min at 500 psi, and most likely higher at lower pressures. 40ml/min isn't a lot, but it accumulates to 57,6l of water per day. If 50l of water is filtered in 1 day, and the filter residue can then be extracted into 50ml of sample water, an up-concentration factor of 1000 has been achieved, which should be sufficient for most experiments.

To direct the water flow several valves will also be required. Figure \ref{fig:filter} presents a water filtration system, complete with valves and tubing, which can be implemented inside the penetrator, allowing up-concentration of the surrounding water. In this system, a disk-shaped filter is used in combination with a central valve which open or blocks the water flow into the instrument suite, as well as a system of valves (flaps) which opens or blocks external water flow to up-concentrating side of the filter. After the sample reaches the instrument suite, other valves can direct which specific instruments should receive the sample.

\end{figure}

A different filtration system was also investigated, in which a pump and a flat filter is used to up-concentrate particles on the surface of the filter, and a mechanical scraper is then used to scrape the surface of the filter, thereby collecting a high concentrate sample. Although a simple solution, the mechanical parts of the scraper might prove less durable than simple valves, and may also end up damaging the filter during operation. 

\autsection{Robot Arm}{Rasmus Lundby Pedersen} % Rasmus
%\chapterauthor{Rasmus L. Pedersen}
Sample manipulation, and extraction, is a central part of lander-based extraterrestrial space exploration. Remote sensing measurements are usually based on non-intrusive observations done at large distances, but it's sometimes necessary to get up and close to the subjects of interest for certain types of material analysis. When measuring factors like temperature, salinity and pH values of a material, close proximity is required and this can either be accomplished by moving all, or part, of the instrument suite close to the sample, or by extracting it to a typically larger central-based instrument laboratory. This section covers the design of a robotic sample manipulator that can achieve both scenarios.

\subsection{Considerations and Drivers}
There are several assumptions that are critical to the design of the robotic sample manipulator. These include, but are not limited to:
\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{High pressure environment}. The manipulator arm is presumably attached to the side of the penetrator, and will be deployed when the vehicle penetrates the bottom of the ice-crust. The common assumption is that the penetrator will experience around 12MPa of pressure at most, but this value may be as high as 36MPa in an absolute worst-case scenario\footnote{$P=\rho g d$, where $\rho\approx 0.92\,\mathrm{kg\cdot m^{-3}}$ for ice-water, $g\approx 1.314\,\mathrm{m\cdot s^{-1}}$ is the approximate gravitational acceleration at Europa's surface and $d=\,30\mathrm{km}$ is the assumed upper limit of the ice-crust thickness}.
\item \textbf{Possible salt-rich water environment}. Material selection should take possible salt-water corrosion into account, since it could be a potential mission-killer.
\item \textbf{Mechanical robustness}. The existence of currents and possible turbulence in the water underneath the crust is currently unknown, and thus is it necessary to design for what could be a very violent marine environment. 
\end{itemize}
These assumption help build a framework of limitations and possibilities for the following instrument suite.
\subsubsection{Sample extraction and reach}
When Earth-based living organisms die and decompose in underwater anaerobic processes, they have shown to form carbon-rich fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gases. These typically exhibit characteristics of having smaller density than water, and will therefore rise to the ice-crust, making the immediate layer underneath the ice an area of interest, with regard to the selection of a sampling location. \\
The samples of interest are most likely liquid, but we must consider the possibility that some organic material are embedded in the ice, due to frequent melting and refreezing of lowest part of the ice-sheet. Therefore, a mechanical element should be positioned at the tip of the manipulator arm so that a small amount of the frozen ice may be dug out, possibly melted by a heating element, and extracted.
\\
\\It must be assumed that the penetrator itself may cause contamination of the surrounding ice when penetrating the crust, as well as introducing a difference in pressure between the water underneath the crust, and the water column melted by the penetrator. The pressure underneath the ice will likely be higher than the pressure in the water column due to possible turbulence, and may suck up a lot of the material located just around the entry-hole. The exact size of the affected area is almost completely unknown since it depends on a myriad of factors, but an approximate reach of $1\,\mathrm{m}$ away from the penetrator should enable us to extract undisturbed ice from the ice-ceiling.
\\
\\A small instrument suite should be placed directly in the tip on the arm to measure the water and ice directly, but some of the sample should be extracted and moved to a centralized instrument suite located in the penetrator, due to space restrictions on the arm.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
With the formulation of the overall goal of the manipulator presented, this section will consider the technical considerations of the arm's design.
\subsubsection{Drill Head}
Temperature profiles previously presented for the ice layer shows, that the ice at the boundary of the liquid sea may be just beneath the freezing point of ice. This makes it a lot easier to dig in and serves as a basis for the design of a drill head.\\
There are several methods for drilling in ice, and this is a central point of discussion with regard to the penetrator descent drilling. The advantages and disadvantages was discussed with the focus of optimizing power-coupling to the ice, and prospective solutions included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mechanical drilling
\item Laser drilling
\item Sputtering
\item Light concentration drilling
\end{itemize}
At first, light concentration can quickly be disregarded at the present depth of several kilometres, since transportation of natural light from the surface clearly isn't a viable effective solution. Artificial light concentration would technically be indistinguishable from laser drilling.\\
\\
Laser drilling and sputtering are both good alternatives, where the ice would be melted and directly extracted to the penetrator's instrument suite. However, this presents the obstacle that the desired sample-water may be diluted by the surrounding naturally-liquid water and defeat the entire purpose of drilling in the soft ice ceiling. One major advantage is that this method wouldn't require the physical support structure mechanical drilling would.\\
\\
Extracting ice samples with a mechanical drill head carries its own problems, since it would both bring considerable weight from the metal materials, and power consumption associated with motorization of the head, as well a structural stability issues. Cutting, or digging, into the ice requires that pressure is applied from the manipulator arm to the ice, which in turn will result in a reactionary force pushing back on the tethered penetrator which the arm is mounted on. However, this may not be a stand-alone problem, since the mobility of the robotic arm will also require stabilizing arms in any case, and thus will that problem be solved.\\
Power coupling to the ice is also relevant, since the required specific cutting energy varies between methods. The subject of specific cutting energy was touched upon in section covering the penetrator drilling, and is a number that tells us how much energy it takes to remove a unit volume of material. The specific cutting energy is for solid arctic ice, according to [Talalay, Pavel G., 2016]\cite{IceDrill}, (590-680$\,\mathrm{MJ\cdot m^{-3}}$) for thermal drills\footnote{Electric thermal coring drilling and hot-point drilling } and (1.9-4.8$\,\mathrm{MJ\cdot m^{-3}}$) for mechanical drills. It's not clear what type of ice the drill methods were tested in, but this is somewhat irrelevant since the relative specific cutting energy between the methods should be more or less independent of the ice's state.\\ 
Tests have shown that a $CO_2$ laser at $10.6\,\mathrm{\mu\cdot m}$ was able melt about $0.8\,\mathrm{mm\cdot s^{-1}}$ in solid ice, with an intensity of about $50\,\mathrm{W\cdot cm^{-2}}$. Converted to specific cutting energy, this gives:
\begin{equation}
E_{s,laser}=10\cdot\frac{50}{0.8}\,\mathrm{J\cdot cm^{-3}}=625\,\mathrm{MJ \cdot m^{-3}}
\end{equation} 
Which is very similar to that of thermal drilling, which lase-drilling would be a sub-set of. Therefore, it seems that mechanical drilling would be around two orders of magnitude more efficient than thermal- and laser drilling, without accounting for the efficiency of the motor driving the drill bit. \\
\\
It was mentioned that the extracted samples should be retrieved in liquid form, which the laser drilling method intrinsically does. However, a solution to this with regard to mechanical drilling could be to design the head as a cutting wheel with shovelled teeth that could lead the material to a small tube, that would suck the solid ice in by the use of a peristaltic pump. The isolated solid ice would be melted by a electrical heating element and moved further back to the penetrator instrument suite. \\
It could also be possible to a regular conveyor belt-type drill to extract the solid ice, but digging into the ice would anchor the drill head and reduce mobility during sampling. A wheel-bucket cutter like the one seen on figure \ref{fig:WheelCut}  would be more free to move around, assuming that only a shallow cut into the ice would be required.  
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{figures/Rasmus/WheelCutter}
	\caption{Bucket-Wheel cutter design \cite{Vonbucket}.
	\label{fig:WheelCut}}
\end{figure}
\\Selection of wheel-drill material both depends on the required hardness of the material in compared to what's being drilled in, as well as resistance to galvanic corrosion in electrolyte-rich environments like the potential salt-water of Europa's ocean. Titanium and Platinum are both excellent drill bit materials, but are excessively heavy and expensive for the current situation. We assume that we only have to drill in soft ice just below the freezing temperature of water, and thus is strength not as critical an issue. However, we do want to be covered in case of misinterpretation, leading to us encountering harder ice than anticipated. Drill bits made from \textbf{stainless steel} are commonly found in commercial ice-drilling due to its high strength and relatively high metal nobility\cite{Corrosion}.\\
\\

\subsubsection{The Arm and its Degrees of Freedom (DOF)}
Another design aspect is the number, and complexity of the manipulator arm's joints. The bottom tip of the penetrator will likely be occupied by the RTG heating tip used for melting through the ice, so the robot arm should be mounted at a small off-set from the tip. The exact dimensions are currently not now, but it's assumed around 10cm from the tip. The final design should take this into consideration. As mentioned before, the reach of the arm should be at least around $1\, \mathrm{m}$ away, normal to the length of the body at the end closes to the ice. It can be assumed that it's possible for the manipulator arm to be folded down alongside the length of the penetrator body during descent, covering around 75\% of the body's length. One option is to design it as a human arm with a shoulder joint mounted $75\,\mathrm{cm}$ from the ice when hanging tethered from the anchor in the ice (The anchoring could be designed so that this height is variable), an elbow joint, and a wrist joint serving as a mount for the drill bit, and a few instruments - possible in a finger configuration where the instrument are extruded away from the wrist joint in individual finger elements. With this set-up, the arm could be folded over once by the elbow joint, giving a maximum length of 1.5m and in turn a reach of\\
\begin{equation}
R_{reach}=\sqrt{(1.5\,\mathrm{m})^2-(0.75\,\mathrm{m})^2}=1.3\,\mathrm{m}
\end{equation}
Which is sufficient with regard to the requirement of $1,\mathrm{m}$.\\
We are not expecting large variances in the ice composition around the penetrator, which limits the requirement of mobility, since it means we only need to extend the arm straight away from the body. Therefore, are we assuming that no more than one DOF is needed for either the shoulder or elbow joint. The "wrist" joint at the end of the arm, where the drill and an few instruments would be placed should, however, have two DOF's in order to adapt to the possibility of the ice-ceiling being a non-smooth surface with a varying landscape. Pressure sensors mounted on either side of the drill bit could help determine whether the manipulator is in contact with the ice or not, and perhaps help roughly mapping the ice locally around the tip of the arm.\\
\\
As mentioned earlier, the mobility of the arm and the reactionary forces from cutting in the ice, would result in stability issues for the penetrator. Therefore, stabilizing arms should be mounted on the body of the penetrator. One possibility is having one spring-loaded arm mounted directly adjacent (180$^\circ$ around the body) to the manipulator, and two arms located 90$^\circ$ around the body from the first stabilizing arm and the manipulator, directly adjacent to each other.\\
These would, like the robot arms, be folded to the side of the penetrator and released by spring-loaded joints when the penetrator has reached the desired altitude with respect to the ice-ceiling. They should be mounted at the same height of the penetrator body as the manipulator arm and would be extended in a 45$^\circ$ angle from the body when deployed. With a total length of $l_{support}=\frac{0.75\,\mathrm{m}}{cos(45^\circ)}=1.06\,\mathrm{m}$, the tips of the arms would then dig into the ice if the penetrator was to be moved by either water-turbulence or the pushing from the drill bit on the manipulator.


\subsubsection{Autonomy}
Deep-sea remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) are usually, as the name suggests, controlled remotely with a live video feed, which is an advantage when investigating unknown sites, underwater structures and animal life. This is primarily due to the need for being able to adapt to the conditions surrounding the ROV. However, this is not possible for the Europa exploration mission, because of the extremely short communication windows and relay times between the penetrator and Earth. The manipulator arm must therefore be autonomous, to a level where it's able to locate, measure and harvest samples by itself when commanded to do so. 

%\subsubsection{Material Extraction}

\subsubsection{Neutral Buoyancy}
Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROV) used Earth-based are usually designed to have neutral buoyancy in the water. This gives ROV significantly more manoeuvrability, since the its thrusters won't have to work against the gravity of Earth, due to its ability to free-float in the water. The same criteria is desirable for the manipulator arm on the Europa ice-penetrator, with regard to joint stability and power usage of their actuators. With the arm being buoyancy neutral, the only requirements of the joints in terms of power stems from the desired rotational velocity of the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints, which in turn is dependent of the mass of the arm, the instruments mounted on the wrist joint, and the drill at the tip.\\
The general method of obtaining neutral buoyancy is by distributing a material with a density significantly lower than that of water, around the object of interest (desirably above the center of mass for stability considerations). For the arm, the weight isn't distributed uniformly along its length, so neither should the buoyancy material be.\\
Syntactic foam has been widely used and tested for deep-sea high-pressure sea environments. Briefly explained, syntactic foam is a composite material synthesized by infusing a material with hollow gas-containing microballoons. This creates a material with lower overall density and often higher specific strength, which is specifically useful for applications including but not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deep-sea buoyancy foams.
\item Accoustically attenuating materials.
\item Blast mitigating materials.
\end{itemize}
The strength and low density of the syntactic foam makes it ideal for deep-sea neutral-buoyancy ROV designs, and is therefore worth considering for the penetrator manipulator arm.\\
As mentioned earlier, the expected amount of pressure underneath the ice-ceiling is around $12\,\mathrm{MPa}$, but the absolute assumed theoretical maximum is $36\,\mathrm{MPa}$ which is the equivalence of approximately $3500\,\mathrm{MSW}$\footnote{$1\, \mathrm{MSW}$ is a non-SI unit roughly equivalent to $1\, \mathrm{bar}$}. The AZ-grade syntactic foam offered by Engineered Syntactic Systems is rated for a depth of $4000\,\mathrm{MSW}$ with a density of $465\,\mathrm{\frac{Kg}{m^3}}$, making it viable as a solution.\\
We currently don't know the behaviour of syntactic foam in vacuum, so the housing of the manipulator arm may have to be pressurized during the travel to Europa.

\subsection{Implementation and Design Specifications}
A solution used for scaling reference is the Schilling Robotics TITAN 4 Manipulator \cite{Titan4}, seen on figure \ref{fig:titan4}, driven by hydraulic at the shoulder and an electrical motor at the elbow and wrist joints.
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/Rasmus/Titan4}
	\caption{Titan 4 robotic arm structural drawing, including dimension.
	\label{fig:titan4}}
\end{figure}
 It's made from titanium, and is much larger than the available space on the penetrator, but the relative dimensions and design type can be used for reference. The number of joints, their complexity and individual DOF complies with the mentioned design criterias. However, the manipulator claw at its tip should be replaced by the "hand" consisting of the manipulator wheel-cutter and 2-3 external instruments.\\
The TITAN 4 has a fully extenden arm-length of $2\,\mathrm{m}$, so this could at least be reduced to the required $\mathbf{1.5\,\mathrm{m}}$, $75\,\mathrm{cm}$ per arm section. The storage room for the arm during descent is extremely limited, with the cylinder structure of the penetrator having an outer cross-sectional radius of only $10\,\mathrm{cm}$. Since the penetrator will be filled with other measuring instruments, the arm may only have $300\cdot10^{-3} \,\mathrm{m^3}$ of space, with a folded length of $0.75\,\mathrm{cm}$. This means that the simplified  cross-sectional dimensions must be no more than $2\times 1\,\mathrm{cm}$ (since it would be folded). This is fairly small, and structural analysis on the arm with these dimension would be required for the final solution. From intuition, and not having any experience with mechanical and structual engieering, it does seem like the arm would be too flexible with these dimensions (and movable joints) of $1\times 2\times 150\,\mathrm{cm}$. This may eliminate the possibility of a robotic arm as we want it to be fairly stable in the water.\\ 
The mass of the full-size arm in air is $100\,\mathrm{kg}$, which would make the modified arm alone:
\begin{equation}
m_{arm}=\frac{1.5\,\mathrm{m}}{2\,\mathrm{m}}\cdot\frac{1\,\mathrm{cm}}{30\,\mathrm{cm}}\frac{2\,\mathrm{cm}}{30\,\mathrm{cm}}\cdot 100\,\mathrm{kg}=0.166\,\mathrm{kg}
\end{equation}
Which seems very small. It would also be possible to modify the design, in order to make it more efficient, with regard to storage space. Re-designing the elbow joint so that the arm folds the other way, would make the folded arm more or less flush with the extruding mount, and it could also be possible to make the arm wider, but leave space in its center, so that it could be folded within itself.\\
It is not know how the arms depth rating of $4000\,\mathrm{MSW}$ would be affected by the size scaling, with respect to the hydraulic shoulder joint.\\
\\
Assuming the arm is made solely out of titanium, which has a density of $2700\,\frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m^3}}$, the effective volume of the arm will be 
\begin{equation}
V_{eff,arm}=\frac{m_{arm}}{\rho_{alu}}=\frac{0.166\,\mathrm{kg}}{2700\,\mathrm{\frac{kg}{m^3}}}=61.5\cdot 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m^3}
\end{equation}
\\
In order for the arm have neutral buoyancy, the gravitational forces on the arms$+$the buoyancy material must cancel out with the buoyancy forces of the two. We assume that the instruments and the drill bit weighs $m_{drill}=2\,\mathrm{kg}$ and has the density of steel with a volume of $V_{drill}=2\times 2 \times 0.5 \, \mathrm{cm}=2\,\mathrm{cm^3}=2\cdot 10^{-6}m^3$. If the volume of the syntactic foam is denounced by $V_{buoy}$, the equation will for the arm in salt water ($\rho_{saltwater}=1029 \, \mathrm{\frac{kg}{m^3}}$) be:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&m_{arm}+V_{buoy}\cdot \rho_{buoy} + m_{drill}=(V_{buoy}\cdot + V_{arm}+V_{drill})\rho_{saltwater}\\
&\rightarrow 0.166\,\mathrm{kg}+V_{buoy}\cdot 465 \mathrm{\frac{kg}{m^3}}+2\,\mathrm{kg}=(V_{buoy}+61.5\cdot 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m^3}+2\cdot 10^{-6}m^3)\cdot 1027 \,\mathrm{\frac{kg}{m^3}}\\
& \leftrightarrow V_{buoy} = 3.738\cdot 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m^3}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Adding more volume to the problem isn't desired, and we may have to conclude that there simply isn't space enough to store the robot arm during descent, for the current design parameters.\\
With the added syntactic foam of $m_{foam}=3.738\cdot 10^{-3} \,\mathrm{m^3}\cdot 465\mathrm{\frac{kg}{m^3}}=1.7382\,\mathrm{kg}$, and the drill head with a few instruments, the arm will weigh and can take up somewhere around:\
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
m_{arm,total}=0.166\,\mathrm{kg}+2\,\mathrm{kg}+1.7832\,\mathrm{kg}=3.95\,\mathrm{kg}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{arm,total}=61.5\cdot 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m^3}+2\cdot 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m^3}+3.738\cdot 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m^3}=3.8\,\mathrm{m^3}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Which shows that most of the space will be taken up by the buoyancy material. This can be solved by using a lighter material like steel, but the stiffness of this material may be too low with respect to the structual dimensions of the arm.\\
It's unsure how the power consumption of the motors and control systems scale with size, but they are not expected to use more than $P_{arm}=20\,\mathrm{W}$ in total, when running.\\
A simply estimation of the total mass, volume and power costs of the manipulator arm can be seen on table \ref{tab:Arm}.

\begin{table}[htb]

	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
	\hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Total mass, volume and power costs of the manipulator arm.}

\end{table}
The power and weight costs seem to be within reasonable ranges.

\autsection{CTD/ADCP}{Jean-Paul Breuer}
CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) and ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) are two instruments that are very much typical and frequently used in oceanography. The CTD is lowered through the water column taking measurements of the water and creating a profile of the salinity and temperature throughout the column. The ADCP is used for determining the speed and direction of an underwater current. These instruments are important because it is critical to get an understanding of the conditions within the ocean, not only to find life, but to be able to further understand how the system is functioning and coevolving with the tidal wave and orbit around Jupiter. It might even give some interesting data if there are black smokers or any kind of uncommon activity in the area (or which may get dragged past due to the current).

Typically the CTD and ADCP are fairly small and lightweight, but are two separate instruments; however, there was an idea for how to effectively join the two instruments to get the same information and save some space in the instrument suite. To approach the problem by starting with assumptions, the instruments will require to descend through the water column, but to increase the output of data, it would be ideal to reduce the rate of descent while also increasing the sampling area so that there is a larger water column with samples. The idea is to drop the instrument into the water and to have hydrofoils that enable it to glide in large spirals down from the top of the water column to the sediment at the depths of the ocean. 

To get this spiral trajectory, the instrument must have a large forward vector relative to the descent vector, while also having a small angular acceleration so that as the instrument moves forward it slowly rotates the forward vector. There must be some kind of echo-sounder like communication system on board so that it can communicate with the penetrator as it collects data during the descent, which could be received by the receivers from the radar echo sounder that was used for detecting the end of the ice column. As the instrument makes its descent, the tidal wave will push it in a relative direction, and if there are alternative currents, they will then push the instrument in those relative directions which would also give a distribution along the water column. If this glide spiral has a large enough radius and slow rate of descent, it would also provide a time series of the current and water profile.

\autsection{Light sensor system}{Søren Jeppesen}

Modern light sensors can be highly sensitive, and would therefore be effective at looking for sources of light underneath the ice. Sources of light could harbor some form of life, or the source itself could be the result of bioluminescence, and it would therefore be relevant to look for such sources in order to identify the possibility of life on Europa. Bioluminescence is a common phenomenom in the deep sea on earth, and although life on Europa would not necesarrily be similar to that on Earth, the possibility of life on Europa sharing these features should be considered. The low weight and small size of light sensors such as photomultiplier tubes (PMT) and avalanche photodiodes (APD) combined with their sensitivity makes these top considerations for a space mission. 

\subsection{Photomultiplier Tubes}

Photomultiplier tubes are highly sensitive light detectors with high signal-to-noise ratio, belonging to the vacuum tube class. PMTs operate primarily in the near-infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectrum of light, but are not equally sensitive in he spectral range measured, and will often heavily favour certain spectral regions depending on design. With sufficient voltage, photomultiplier tubes are able to achieve extremely high gain making photomultiplier tubes able to generate a response from single photons.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/RCS/photomultiplier_tube}
\caption{A common photomultiplier tube \cite{PMT_picture}.}
\label{fig:PMT}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The light sensing part of the PMT is the photo-cathode. This part is a negatively charged electrode coated with a photosensitive compound, located  the front of the tube and enveloped in vacuum. Due to the photoelectric effect, electron are emitted when a photon strikes the photocathode. Electrons emitted in the photocathode are picked up by an applied electric field and accelerated towards another electrode in the vacuum envelope, known as a dynode. The dynode works as an electron multiplier through secondary emission. When an electron generated in the photocathode strike the dynode, several new electrons are produced. These new electrons are then accelerated towards a secondary dynode where new electrons are subsequently emitted, thus further multiplying the electron amount. An anode then collects the electrons emitted by the dynodes, which provides a signal that can be read.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/RCS/PMT}
\caption{An illustration of how the dynodes strengthen signal \cite{Dynode}.}
\label{fig:PMT_dynode}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The strength of the PMT is the high gain this device is able to achieve with sufficient voltage. Gain is a term used to describe the amplification of a signal, which in the case of an optical sensor, is the ratio of the incoming photons to measured current output. In a PMT, each dynode increases the current as

\begin{equation}
    I_n = d_1 \cdot d_2 \cdot d_3 ... d_{n-1} \cdot d_n \cdot I_k
\end{equation}

Where $I_k$ is the photocathode current and $d_1 \rightarrow d_n$ are the dynode amplifications. A PMT tube is capable of reaching a gain of several tens of millions with enough dynodes and applied voltage as shown in figure \ref{fig:dynode_gain}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/RCS/dynodegain}
\caption{A graph showing how the gain in a PMT increases with increased bias and increased number of dynodes \cite{Dynode_gain}.}
\label{fig:dynode_gain}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Quantum efficiency is a measure for how many percent of the incoming photons that produce a signal in the photocathode. For PMTs, the quantum efficiency is around 30\% - 40\% depending on the type and the measured light spectrum, meaning that 60\% - 70\% of incoming photons are not detected. This is much lower than those of comparable light sensors such as APDs, with quantum efficiencies around 80\%.

The materials used for the photocathodes and windwos greatly influences the characteristics of the PMT. Most photocathodesare made of alkali metals from group 1 of periodic table known as alkali metals. Some of the common photocathodes are:

Caesium iodide is a type of ”solar blind” photocathode, meaning that it is not sensitive to solar radiation. Due to having low sensitivity at wavelenghts above 200 nm, this type of photocathode is used for ultraviolet radiation. 
\\
\item Cs-Te:\\
Caesium telluride is another type of solar blind photocathode. This type of photocathode is sensitive to wavelengths longer than 300 nm however.
\\
\item Cs-Sb:
Caesium antimony is sensitive in a much broader spectrum, capable of sensing both ultraviolet and visible light. Thus type of photocathode is favorable when when the intetnsity of the measured light is high.
\\
\item Bialkali (Sb-Rb-Cs, Sb-K-Cs:\\ 
Antimony-rubidium-caesium and antimony-potassium-caesium photocathodes are useful in both ultraviolet and visible spectrum. Compared to the caesium-antimony photocathode, the bialkali have higher sensitivity and lower dark current.
\\
\item Sb-Na-K:\\
antimony-sodium-potassium bialkali photocathode is sensitive in spectrum similar to the previous bialkali, but has lower sensitivity. This type of photocathode is able to withstand much higher temperatures, up to 175 $^circ$ Celcius, whereas other types of photocathodes usually go up to 50 degrees.
\\
\item Sb-Na-K-Cs:\\
The multialkali Antimony-sodium-potassium-caesium is useful from ultraviolet to near-infrared. This type of photocathode is also highly sensitive.
\\
\item Ag-O-Cs:\\ 
Silver-oxygen-caesium is sensitive from visible to near-infrared. This type of photocathode provides slightly lower sensivity in the visible region, but higher sensitivity in the high wavelengths compared to other photocathodes.
\\
\item GaAsP (Cs):\\
Caesium-activated Gallium arsenide phosphide photocathodes has higher quantum efficiency in the visible region. This is offset with no sensitivity in the ultraviolet region and high degradation-rate when exposed to high intensity radiation.
\\
\item GaAs (Cs):\\
Caesium-activated Gallium arsenide photocathodes provides sensitivity in a broad range, spanning from ultraviolet to near-infrared, with nearly flat, high sensitivity in most of this spectral range.
\\
\item InGaAs:\\ 
Indium gallium arsenide photocathodes are sensitive further into the infrared region than GaAs, while also providing good signal-to-noise ratio compared to other photocathodes useful in this region.
\end{itemize}

Due dark current, leakage current between dynodes, or high-energy radiation, PMTs can produce a signal in complete dark. Electronic noise which contributes to the dark current on top of thermally emitted electrons, is often included in the value of the dark current. The dark current is described as the small electric current that exists the device in the complete absence of photons. 

\subsection{Avalanche Photodiodes}
Avalanche photodiodes are a type of semiconductor-based, highly sensitive light detectors. Like PMTs, APDs convert radiation to electricity through the photoelectric effect, but operate using reverse voltage (voltage at the cathode is more positive than the voltage at the anode) rather than forward voltage. APDs exploit the avalanche multiplication in order to generate a readable signal, that is, radiation causes electrons to be excited in the detection material which is then accelerated by the applied electric field and excites more electrons. This process happen in the multiplication region of the device, which is made from a semiconducting material.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/RCS/APD}
\caption{A common Avalanche photodiode \cite{APD_pic}.}
\label{fig:APD}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The gain for APDs is much lower than what is attainable with PMT. At 100-200 volt reverse bias, typical gain values are around 100, and is strongly depend on the supplied voltage.  If the voltage is increased too much, breakdown will occur and the current in the diode will increase exponentially. A gain of this size is too small to detect single photons, but modern doping techniques have allowed for some avanlanche photodiodes to operate at applied voltage greater than 1500 volts allowing for gains up to 1000. This is not common APDs though, and these high gain APDs represent a small amount of highly modern APDs. These devices are much more sensitive in the near-infrared and visible regions compared to ultraviolet. APDs can reach quantum efficiencies of 80\% - 90\% at peak wavelengths, but as seen on figure \ref{fig:APD_specs}, the quantum efficiency drops sharply on either side of the peak.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/RCS/APD_specs}
\caption{Graphs of gain as function of temepature and bias for a highly sensitive, near-infrared, silicon APD (left). Quantum efficiency as function of wavelength for the same device (right) \cite{APD_graphs}.}
\label{fig:APD_specs}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A way to measure single photons using an APD is activate Geiger mode, which is to operate it carefully just above breakdown voltage. In this state, even a single photon will produce a massive electron avalanche in the device which can then be read. During Geiger mode, the APD will need to rest between detections, lowering the detection frequency of the device. Thermally generated carriers within the device can also trigger avalanches, giving counts even in complete darkness.\\

APDs suffer from noise due to the nature of the electron avalanche process. This excess noise factor is denoted $F$, and for $k$ < 0.1 and $M$ > 20 can be approximated by the formula \cite{APD_noise}.

\begin{equation}
    F = 2 + k \cdot M
\end{equation}

where $k$ is carrier ionization ratio and $M$ is the gain of the photodiode. The square root of $F$ represents the factor by which the statistical noise of the APD rises above what would be expected from a noiseless multiplier due to only Poissonian statistics.\\

The  multiplication region of the APD is typically made of either silicon, germanium or Indium gallium arsenide.

\begin{itemize}

\item Si is sensitive in the visible and near-infrared area with low excess noise. Typical gain is 100, although it can be manufactured to attain up to 500. Excess noise factor is around 4.
\\
\item Ge is sensitive in the infrared region up to 1700 nm, but with high excess noise. Typical gain is 10 with excess noise factor of 9.
\\
\item InGaAs is sensitive in the infrared region. Typical gain is 10 and excess noise factor around 5.
\\
\item Gallium nitride can be used for an avalanche photodiode sensitive in the ultraviolet region. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The mission}

The purpose of the light sensor system is to search for light sources beneath the ice on Europa. It is interesting to search for light as the two main sources of light beneath the ice will either be from living organisms themselves in the form of bio-luminescence, or an energy source that life can potentially feed on. As such, if there is light beneath the ice, it is probable that any existing life will be close by. It must be expected that light sources will be difficult to find as it is likely that any source of light beneath the ice is both very rare and very weak. The water itself also has high absorption of light at certain wavelengths,as shown in figure \ref{fig:water_abs}, further increasing the difficulty of detecting light.  

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/RCS/absorption_watef}
\caption{Graph of the absorption coefficient of water as function of wavelength \cite{water_abs}.}
\label{fig:water_abs}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The light sensor system brought on the mission should therefore be as sensitive as possible in order to maximize the probability of detecting possible sources. Detection capability is not the only important parameter however, as weight and volume must be considered due to the limitations of space missions. Previously, two detection devices for light sensor systems has been discussed, the photomultiplier tube and the avalanche phototiode. The table below displays for each device some of parameters that are important to consider for choosing a light sensor system for the mission.\
	
%% table for PMT and APD parameters
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
               & QE & Gain & Mass & Size & Bias \\
 \textbf{PMT:} & 30\% - 40\% & Several million & 50-100 gram & Few centimeters & 1000-2000 V \\ 
 \textbf{APD:} & 80\% - 90\% & A few hundreds & A few grams  & Few mm or microns $\mathrm{\mu}m$ & 50-400 V \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
	
The high gain of the PMT gives it an advantage over the APD in detecting weak sources. The higher quantum efficiency of the APD gives it an advantage in detecting rare signals as long as the signal is strong enough to warrant a response in the device. The essential difference is in the weight, size, and bias requirement, where the much smaller and lighter APD is more suited for space missions, as it is easier to integrate with the overall system. Despite its limitations in detection, the APD is favorable in every other aspect and is therefore the most suitable detection device for the mission.

\subsection{Bias power supply}
The APD will need a bias power supply to operate. For most APDs it will suffice to have 100-200 volt in reverse bias to attain maxium to gain without hitting the breakdown voltage, but up to 400 V can be needed for some specific high-gain APD. A bias power supply  further complicates the light sensor system as it increases the mass the and the volume significantly. The Hamamatsu APD module C5658 is a highly sensitive silicon APD build into a working module with a bias power supply, which will be used as baseline for the mass and volume requirements of and APD module \cite{APD_module}. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/RCS/APDmodule}
\caption{The Hamamatsu APD module C5658 APD module \cite{APD_module}}
\label{fig:APD_module}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This APD module weighs 120 g with a dimensional outline of 2.8 cm x 5.0 cm x 6.0 cm for a total volume of 84 $\mathrm{cm^3}$, making it both lightweight and small in size. With some optimization of the electronics, and by removing cover, it should be possible to get well below 80 g for the module. 

\subsection{Proposed models}
Two APD types are proposed for the Europa Life Finder Mission. The first model is for the visible spectrum of light, and the second is for the near-infrared spectrum.

\begin{description}
\item[Excelitas C30739ECERH]:
The Excelitas C30739ECERH Series APD is a high gain, large area silicon detector optimized for the visible spectrum. At 430 nm, the APD features 75\% quantum efficiency and can reach 450 gain. The chip spans an area of 6.5 mm x 6.5 mm and is operational at temperatures between 0$^circ$ and 50$^circ$ Celsius. The APD requires an operating voltage of 400 V in high gain mode. \cite{APD_visible}
\item[Excelitas C30921SH:]
The Excelitas C30921SH is a high gain near-infrared type silicon APD. This APD reaches 250 gain and the active diameter is 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm. \cite{APD_infrared}
\end{description}

The models are chosen specifically due to their high gain in order to minimize the weakness of the APD. The model chosen for the visible spectrum posseses the highest gain, but at the cost of high operating voltage. As the visible spectrum is where the water has the lowest absorption of light, having the best possible detection in this regime should be considered.

\subsection{Shielding}
The detection device will need to be shielded from the environment on Europa. As APDs function well at the low temperature in the environment, the shielding will focused on protecting the device from the water. Sufficient shielding can be made from simple metal tube sealed with a window at the front end made from suprasil, a quartz with high transparency in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. The structure of the tube will feature a light filtering lens between the window and the detector, and the electronic components furthest back.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/RCS/tube_fisheye}
\caption{An image of a simple aluminum tube as can be used to shield the sensor from water (left). An image of a common fisheye lens as will be used for window (right). \cite{Al_tube} \cite{Fisheye}}
\label{fig:tube}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

6061 aluminium alloy will be used for the tube, as it low density, and with adequate strength. On figure \ref{fig:wall_thick} is shown the tube wall thickness depending on tube radius at 100 bar pressure. It can be seen that with just a few millimeters of metal, the tube will be more than capable of withstanding the pressure beneath the ice on Europa.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/RCS/Wall_thickness_graph}
\caption{Graph showing the required wall thickness with increased radius of tube.}
\label{fig:wall_thick}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The wall thickness is calculated from the stress in thin-walled cylinders. The equation is \cite{Wall_thickness}

\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{p \cdot r}{\sigma _c}
\end{equation}

where $t$ is the thickness of the wall, $p$ is the pressure and $\sigma _c$ is the hoop stress. As the yield strength of the aluminum alloy is 414 MPa, a maximum of 300 MPa stress was selected in order to ensure that the high strength of the metal ws utilized, but without causing any permanent to the tube. 

For avalanche photodiodes, the window will have to act as a focusing lens in order to increase the area of detection, and will therefore be designed as a fisheye lens. The window will sealed by placing an O-ring between the window and and tube edge and then bolting the window to the tube itself, a technique similar to that of high-pressure windows in submarines. A fisheye lens made of suprasil with a radius of 2 cm and a density of 2200 $\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ will weight in the area of 5 gram, with a half-sphere design. In total, it should be possible to construct an APD modul with shielding and focusing lens with mass and size as seen in table \ref{table:module}.

 \textbf{Mass:} & 80 g & 7.8 g & 5 g & 92.8 g  \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Conclusion}

This section has discussed possible light sensor systems for the Europa life-finding mission, and how to modify it for use in the environment beneath the ice on Europa. Between two different highly sensitive detection devices, photomultiplier tubes and avalanche photo diodes, the photo diodes were found to be the most suitable for a space mission due to low size, weight, and power consumption. The shielding used for the device is a thin aluminum tube sealed with a suprasil window, which is lightweight and more than able to withstand the pressure. A complete light sensor system unit with electrical components and shielding will be possible at less than 250 grams pr. sensor, making them light enough to be valid considerations for the mission. Due to how the quantum efficiency of APDs vary with wavelength of incoming radiation, it is suggested to use two units with different peak wavelengths such to ensure best possible detection in both the visible spectrum and the near-infrared spectrum. The ultraviolet spectrum can also be investigated, but as water has high absorption and APDs have low detection in spectrum, it will not be as efficient as looking in the visible and near-infrared.

\subsection{Further work}

The main discussion points that has been left out of the section are how many light sensor systems the mission should bring, and where to place them on the penetrator. Unlike many of the other life-finding devices, the light sensors will need to be placed so they have view of the outside through the window. This leaves many possible locations on the penetrator itself, but a more interesting set-up would be the robotic arm. Having the light sensor system placed on the arm would add mobility and the capability to search in a much wider area. Due to their light weight and size, it would be worth considering bringing several systems to look in several directions at once, vastly increasing the chances of detecting possible life. Further work in collaboration with the experts the robotic arm and mass budget experts would therefore be required in order to investigate whether these concepts would be possible.

\autsection{HPLC}{Morten Lykke Hilligsøe}
\label{sec:hplc}
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC and also known as high-pressure liquid chromatography), is a chemical technique commonly used to identify, quantify and separate components of a liquid sample. Most commonly, the technique uses pressure to pump a solvent through a column filled with silica beads covered in carbohydrates. The silica beads typically have a size range of 2–50 micrometers in diameter. By mixing the sample with a polar solvent, such as acetonitrile or methanol, and passing it through the highly non-polar silica beads, each component of the sample will interact differently with the column, thereby affecting flow rates of each compound and making it possible to separate them. \cite{wiki_hplc}

Many different HPLC techniques exist, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Partition chromatography
    \item Normal–phase chromatography
    \item Displacement chromatography
    \item Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC)
    \item Size-exclusion chromatography
    \item Ion-exchange chromatography
    \item Bioaffinity chromatography
    \item Aqueous normal-phase chromatography
\end{itemize}
with reversed-phase chromatography equipment being very common in chemistry and biochemistry labs all over the world. In reversed-phase chromatography, the components of the sample mixture are separated from each other based on their different interactions with the absorbent particles of the HPLC column, also known as the stationary phase. The pressurized sample/solvent mixture is referred to as a "mobile phase".

\subsubsection{Detection}
HPLC can detect a vast array of different chemical and biochemical compounds, including many compounds considered direct indicators of present life \cite{hplcbasics}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DNA and RNA
    \item Pharmaceuticals like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen (Tylenol) 
    \item Salts like sodium chloride and potassium phosphate 
    \item Proteins like egg white or blood protein 
    \item Organic chemicals like polymers (e.g. polystyrene, polyethylene) 
    \item Heavy hydrocarbons like asphalt or motor oil 
    \item Many natural products such as ginseng, herbal medicines, plant extracts 
    \item Thermally unstable compounds such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) and enzymes 
\end{itemize}
HPLC will not be able detect all of these compounds using a single HPLC column, as different types of columns are optimized for different detection schemes, but a single column will still be able to detect a vast range of compounds. If more compounds are to be detected, a setup with multiple columns could also be designed. Special HPLC setups can also separate and quantify chiral enantiomers, which are considered clear indicators of life, if a set of enantiomers are found in varying concentrations. Such setups are however much less versatile, and are better suited for experiments where the examined compound is known beforehand.
Typically a marker solution is introduced to the system before the sample, in order to have some reference points. Detection limits depends very much on the optical setup (light source \& sensor) and the compound to be detected, but the separation of compounds reduces noise, thereby making it possible to detect concentrations down to µg/L, with just a few µL of sample. Because of these small sample amounts, typical column dimensions are just 2.1–4.6 mm in diameter, and 30–250 mm in length.

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mlh/HPLC.png}
	\caption{Schematic representation of an HPLC unit.

	\label{fig:HPLC}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Components}
Figure \ref{fig:HPLC} illustrates a typical HPLC system. 5 major components are required for a HPLC setup:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pump: The pump is used to force the sample/solution mixture through the column at high pressure and at a specific flow rate. HPLC flow rates are commonly in the 0.1- to 8-mL/min range, with a pressure gradient commonly in the range of 50- to 600-bar.
    \item Injector: The injector introduces the sample into the solvent (mobile phase) flow stream at typical volumes of 5- to 20-µL. As the sample is unpressurized, the injector must be able to withstand the high pressure of the system.
    \item Column: The column’s stationary phase separates the sample components of interest using various physical and chemical parameters, such as polarity, porosity or bioaffinity. The small particles that make up the inside of the column is what causes the high pressure gradient at normal flow rates. 
    \item Detector: The detector can detect the individual compounds in the column output (elute). Usually a UV or wide spectrum light source is used in combination with a sensor which can detect individual wavelengths (e.g. photodiode array). By detecting the individual wavelength absorption of the elute, components can be distinguished, identified and quantified. The elute absorption as a function of time, is the liquid chromatogram result.
    \item Computer: Finally, a computer is used to control the HPLC instruments and might also be used to analyze the resulting chromatogram. As a result, the resulting data of each experiment can vary from megabytes when high resolution chromatographs are transferred, over kilobytes when low resolution chromatographs are transferred, and all the way down to single bytes for yes/no answers or concentrations at specific retention times. 
\end{enumerate}

Besides these components, a HPLC system usually also includes a solvent mixer and a degassing system. 
The mixer is used to create the desired mobile-phase composition, typically from a mix of water, acetonitrile and/or methanol. The mixer isn’t strictly necessary, as one can use a premade mobile-phase solution, but often a gradient of these compounds are desired throughout the experiment, as the mobility range of different compounds would otherwise be too vast, e.g. some move directly through the column, and others doesn’t move at all.

The degassing system is an essential part of any HPLC system used under normal lab conditions, as it ensures that no bubbles are created when the mobile-phase traverses the negative pressure gradient of the HPLC column. Such bubbles will ruin the experiment by blocking any further movement through the column, and can even potentially break the column.  Commonly used degassing practices for HPLC mobile phase are helium purging (removes up to 80\% of all gasses), vacuum degassing (up to 60\%) and sonication (up to 30\%). However, degassing would not be a problem on a subsea space mission for two reasons: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system is closed and all solvents can easily be degassed before departure.
    \item The experiments are performed under high-pressure external conditions (below several kilometers of ice), making sure that the pressure never drops low enough for bubbles to occur.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation}
To implement a HPLC system on the Europa subsea mission, the system will have to be limited in the power usage, weight, volume, and data transfer rates. The following equipment has been used as reference for calculating an approximate weight, power and volume usage:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0.01-10mls/min, 143bar, Stainless Steel, positive displacement piston pump \cite{hplc_motor}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Weight: 1.6kg
        \item Power: 40.8W
        \item Size: 139.7mm x 76.2mm x 266.7mm
    \end{itemize}
    \item Injector \cite{hplc_injector}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Weight: 0.25kg
    \end{itemize}
    \item C18 Reversed-Phase HPLC Column \cite{hplc_columns}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Weight: 0.2kg
        \item Size: 200mm x 2.2mm (internal)
    \end{itemize}
    \item 190-500nm, 13nm resolution, UV Detector \cite{hplc_detector}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Weight: 1.5kg
        \item Power: 60W
        \item Size: 121mm x 129mm x 187mm
    \end{itemize}
    \item Solvent
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 50ml per experiment
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The chosen pump is a displacement piston pump, which are commonly used high pressure low volume applications such as HPLC systems. The possibility of using a peristaltic pump was also examined, but no peristaltic pumps were found, which could operate at +100bars of pressure. Both the injector and HPLC column weights are estimates, as no weights were given by the manufacturers. It would be nice to include a UV-Visible detector which isn’t limited to 500nm detection range, but this component was the most weight efficient solution available. Finally the solvent volume is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    1ml/min \cdot 30min = 30ml    
\end{equation}
Which is then rounded up to 50ml per experiment, because some solvent is also necessary to flush the column before experiments.

Several connectors and peripheral equipment will also be required, resulting in a system which, during operation, requires a power input of approximately 100W, and has a total weight of around 4kg plus approximately 0.05kg of solvent per experiment. The volume and mass of the individual components are quite large when considering the size of the penetrator, but by stripping each component down to the bare minimum, e.g. getting rid of shielding, user interfaces and AC-DC converters, the size and weight should be low enough for the HPLC solution to be contained within the penetrator. 

The data transfer rates can be calculated from the sampling frequency $f$, the sampling range $l$, the sampling resolution $\delta$, and the bit-size $b$ of each measurement point:
\begin{equation}
    f \cdot \frac{l}{\Delta} \cdot b = 1Hz \cdot \frac{500nm-190nm}{13nm} \cdot 12bits = 286bps
\end{equation}
Here the sampling frequency is chosen to be 1Hz, which is on the low end of standard sampling rates of laboratory HPLC experiments, but still good enough for most experiments. The 12 bit measurement point size gives a range from 0-4095. Since the HPLC isn’t expected to run continuously, but only run when an interesting sample has been up-concentrated, the 286bps is far below the maximum transfer limit, and both sampling frequency, sample points and bit size may be increased without creating a bottleneck.

A simple illustration of the system is presented in figure \ref{fig:hplc_drawing}.

\autsection{Lab-on-a-chip \& microscopic sensors}{Morten Lykke Hilligsøe}
Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems are a common description of microfluidic devices which can perform one or several laboratory functions on a single chip. Lab-on-a-chip systems are often characterized by a very small size in the mm2 – cm2 range, high automation requiring only sample injection and result identification, as well as zero chance of contamination due to the closed system. The small size of LOCs also results in extremely small sample sizes, sometimes reaching less than a pico liter, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage, as small amounts of the compound of interest is necessary for detection or analysis, but the small sample volumes can be hard to handle properly. \cite{wiki_loc} \cite{labchip}

LOCs are typically constructed using the same lithographic techniques developed by semi-conductor industry for integrated circuit production, and consists of µm or sub-µm sized mechanical structures such as channels, mixers, valves, pumps and dosing devices, combined with micro-sensors, chemical \& biochemical reagents and/or external sensors, e.g. optical or electrical sensors. LOCs are still a novel technology, but the technology is quickly evolving and LOC solutions have found many uses, especially within biochemical and microbiological analysis, such as bacteria, virus, and bioanalyte detection. \\
\cite{Ghallab2004} \cite{Pawell2013} \cite{Pawell2015} lists advantages and disadvantages of LOCs as:

Advantages of LOCs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item low fluid volumes consumption (less waste, lower reagents costs and less required sample volumes for diagnostics)
    \item faster analysis and response times due to short diffusion distances, fast heating, high surface to volume ratios, small heat capacities.
    \item better process control because of a faster response of the system (e.g. thermal control for exothermic chemical reactions)
    \item compactness of the systems due to integration of much functionality and small volumes
    \item massive parallelization due to compactness, which allows high-throughput analysis
    \item lower fabrication costs, allowing cost-effective disposable chips, fabricated in mass production
    \item part quality may be verified automatically
    \item safer platform for chemical, radioactive or biological studies because of integration of functionality, smaller fluid volumes and stored energies
\end{itemize}
Further advantages for use on space missions, includes the possibility for complete sample processing in a single chip, e.g. filtration, lysing, mixing, chemical reactions and positioning, thereby reducing or completely dismissing any requirements for large and bulky laboratory equipment typically necessary to prepare samples before any analyte can be detected.

Disadvantages of LOCs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item novel technology and therefore not yet fully developed
    \item physical and chemical effects—like capillary forces, surface roughness, chemical interactions of construction materials on reaction processes—become more dominant on small-scale. This can sometimes make processes in LOCs more complex than in conventional lab equipment
    \item detection principles may not always scale down in a positive way, leading to low signal-to-noise ratios
    \item although the absolute geometric accuracies and precision in microfabrication are high, they are often rather poor in a relative way, compared to precision engineering for instance.
\end{itemize}
Further disadvantages for use on space missions, includes that many LOCs are single-use constructions, thereby requiring extra storage space if the experiment is to be performed multiple times, as well as mechanics to switch between chips. Then novelty of LOC technology is also exemplified in the fact, that even though the chip itself can be very small, the external equipment necessary to operate the chip is often standard laboratory equipment which hasn’t been scaled accordingly.

\subsubsection{Systems of interest}
Below is described 4 systems of interest for a life detection mission. Many other relevant projects exists, ranging from small research projects to a few readily available solutions.

\paragraph{DNA extraction and real-time PCR \cite{Oblath2013}}
In an article from 2013, researchers at the University of North Carolina describe a “microfluidic chip integrating DNA extraction, amplification, and detection for the identification of bacteria in saliva”. Such a device could easily be used to detect if DNA is present on Europa. And because the chip has integrated filters, minimal preparation of the sample is required. The system works by filtering lysed organisms through a nanoporous aluminum oxide membrane, followed by PCR amplification of the filtered DNA in 7 parallel reaction wells. PCR amplification is the standard method of up concentrating DNA, and using this method the chip was able to detect as low as 8-12 copies of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus DNA. PCR amplification depend primers to attach to matching DNA sequencing. For a Europa mission, any microorganisms will of course be unknown, and specific target primers will not be available. Instead a series of general primers which bind to DNA sequences common to earth life can be used to simply detect DNA.

The glass cover slip is 150 $\mu m$ thick, the microfluidic base of the chip is \~400 $\mu m$ thick, The AOM is 60 $\mu m$ thick, and the reaction wells are \~2.8 mm tall. The microposts are 75 $\mu m$ in diameter and 18 $\mu m$ tall. The microfluidic channel is 30 $\mu m$ deep and 1.6 cm long. \cite{Oblath2013}}

\paragraph{Chemical sensor \cite{Schwarz2014}}
Although more a sensor than LOC, in 2014, researchers at Vienna University of Technology have developed a very interesting sensor chip, for measuring the chemical composition of liquids. The sensor works by placing a matching set of mid-infrared quantum cascade laser and detector on a single chip connected through a 50 $\mu m$ waveguide. When specific molecules pass close to the waveguide, the laser light is absorbed and the molecule can be detected. The wavelength of quantum cascade lasers can be finely tuned, and lasers matching specific molecules can therefore be created, allowing for detection of various molecules, such as carbohydrates or proteins, and the small size will make it possible to have a whole array of various wavelength sensors to measure the concentration of many different compounds using a single chip.

\paragraph{Movement sensor \cite{Kasas13012015}}
A universal life detection sensor has been developed by Kasas et al. of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, by using a cantilever known, as known from Atomic Force Microscopy, to detect tiny fluctuations, commonly associated with the movement and metabolic activity of cells. The cantilever is essentially a metal beam which can scrape a surface, and if any living organisms get stuck on the cantilever, a laser can detect the tiny vibrations made by metabolic movement. The sensor has been successfully tested with bacteria, yeast, mouse cells, human cells, and plant cells. The unique feature of such sensor is the complete lack of knowledge required about the organism biochemistry. Where other methods rely on the assumption that extraterrestrial life has similar DNA, protein or hydrocarbon chemistry as life on earth, no such assumptions are necessary for this detection method.

When the specimens are immobilized on the sensor, its fluctuations increase (Center). Finally, if the microorganisms are killed, through a chemical or physical agent, the sensor reverts to small fluctuations (Right).}

\paragraph{Wet-chemical analyzers \cite{chemical_microsensors}}
The National Oceanography Centre of the United Kingdom is developing chemical sensors for several of the major nutrients important for oceanic life, which includes nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and phosphate, as well as the trace nutrients, present at low concentrations yet essential for life, such as dissolved iron and manganese, which is a tracer of hydrothermal vent emissions.  Many of these sensors are based on the principle of Flow Injection Analysis, which is commonly used in laboratory equipment, but with the goal of condensing several high precision sensors into a small device which can be used for in-situ deep ocean analysis and monitoring. Such a system is attained by use of microfluidic devices and sensors.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
Although lab-on-a-chip systems and microscopic sensors offer promising products and technologies, many of the applications which are of interest to this mission, are still in a developmental stage, and require further maturing before an extraterrestrial mission can rely on such equipment. The long life of the mission and single-use chips also hinders the effective use of such systems, and it was therefore chosen not to bring LOCs on the Europa subsea mission.
