\paragraph{Link scenario and description of operations}
Three stages in the process of the penetrator descending through the ice crust can be defined to better design the communication system. First, the deployment of the vehicle by lowering it by means of a controlled crane system. In this phase a critical mission operation must be carried out, this is the burial of the lander computer and electronics subsystem to protect it from the surface heavy radiation doses which would shrink the mission life to about a month making it impossible to reach the ocean and carry out the mission goals.

The second phase, would be the penetrator complete buried within the crust and on the melting process to reach the ocean, this might be the longest duration stage depending on the thickness of the crust at the landing site. In this phase, a big risk is the effect of the "slushy" ice trail behind the penetrator. This watery ice would have an increased conductivity and it poses as an obstacle in the path of communication from the penetrator vehicle to the lander. This obstacle mainly affects the antenna pattern characteristics but its effect is greatly dependant on the dimensions of the "slushy" ice trail. On the other hand, a tethered solution would be driven by cable mass necessary for depth goals and to withstand the mechanical forces from being frozen in the ice crust, specially the shear stresses (from sideways motion of ice sheets).

Third, reaching the ocean interface where the main transceiver in the penetrator is left embedded at a safe distance from the interface with the anchoring mechanism for the penetrator and instruments suite. A tether/cable enabled for communications will serve as link from the instruments to the main transceiver and relay the science data and telemetry to surface.

\autsubsection{Ice embedded wireless communications}{Gustavo Feijóo Carrillo}
In a previous study from JPL's Cryobot concept regarding ice communications \cite{iceLink-scott}, we find the assumption of the communication transceiver relays being allowed to refreeze in the ice but there is no deeper details on this matter. The main subject here is the behaviour of the "slushy ice" or water and ice mixture above the descending penetrator, since this trail has a meaningful effect on the antenna performance of the penetrator communication subsystem as shown in Figures \ref{fig:unaffected}, \ref{fig:smallSlush} \& \ref{fig:bigSlush}. The concentration levels of impurities in the water/ice mixture also has an impact but will be leaved for future works, in the present study a salty water of $15ppt$ is used as a simplified model.

The profile shown spans almost 4 days.}

% Effect on link design
\subsubsection{Considerations for Link Sizing and Antenna choice}
The results exposed in Figures \ref{fig:unaffected}, \ref{fig:smallSlush} \& \ref{fig:bigSlush}, show that extraordinary steps must be taken in order to design an antenna to establish a wireless link embedded in ice, specially with impurities present that increase the conductivity of the medium. In the modeling carried in this study the "slushy" trail is considered an obstacle in the near-field and the main effect for the antenna pattern is an increase in the side-lobe level, and this effect is proportional to the size and impurity content of the "slushy" trail. Nevertheless, having the ability to properly model this scenario can provide better insight to achieve the best link performance.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Design Recommendation}

A trade off in design complexity and performance can be made if a high gain antenna is used for the lander if careful considerations are taken to take any tilting of the lander into account. The penetrator should carry two antennas, an with increased gain each in a scheme of low (with full hemisphere coverage behind the penetrator) and a higher gain antenna. In the following section a better detail is given for the higher gain antenna and how the ice link is capable of performing under the conditions given at Europa.
