\autsection{Landing}{Maja Tomicic}
The landing-module should be able to perform a soft pin-point landing on the desired landing spot. The landing procedure should be completely autonomous using real-time on-board data from relevant sensors that are carefully selected ensuring that they meet the requirements for the landing as well as being mass and power efficient. After landing, the primary goal is to get the payload out of the radiation environment, therefore the possibility of melting a preliminary hole in the ice and dropping the payload into it, is investigated.
