\section{Theory}
\autsubsection{Ice Characteristics}{Lukas Christensen}
To evaluate the viability of a landing and possibly penetrating mission to Europa, the characteristics of the moon's ice sheet should be investigated. This includes determining how heat is deposited in the moon and how this affects the ice layer. Additionally, the structural profile of the ice should be analyzed to see what it might tell about the nature of the ice and to find out if landing is realistic. Finally, the temperature profile of the ice should be determined in order to evaluate the viability of a penetrating, possibly thermal, probe.

\autsubsection{Convection}{Lukas Christensen}
The physics of convection should be investigated to ascertain if natural convection can be used as a means of water transportation within a penetrating thermal ice probe. Ideally, simulations should be performed to obtain quantitative measures of its viability.

\autsection{Lander}{Maja Tomicic}
The landing-module should be able to perform a soft pin-point landing on the desired landing spot. The landing procedure should be completely autonomous using real-time on-board data from relevant sensors that are carefully selected ensuring that they meet the requirements for the landing as well as being mass and power efficient. After landing, the primary goal is to get the payload out of the radiation environment, therefore the possibility of melting a preliminary hole in the ice and dropping the payload into it, is investigated.

\section{Penetrator}
\autsubsection{Drilling Methods}{Lukas Christensen}
In order to get through the ice sheet on Europa some sort of penetration method is needed. Various possible solutions must be identified, and each must be analyzed to determine its viability. Once a method has been selected it must be thoroughly investigated and estimates for the penetration time must be provided and validated as it will form the basis of the overall mission design.
