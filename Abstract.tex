\autchapter{Abstract}{Kristian Sloth Lauszus}

This book was done as a compulsory assignment in the course Spacecraft Instrumentation Systems (30320) at National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).\\

\noindent
The book will present a proposal for a mission to the Jovian moon Europa. The goal of the mission is to search for life forms in either the ice or the sub-surface water ocean that is believed to be present on the moon.

The relevant theory about the moon will first be discussed, then a strawman proposal will be presented. Details about the orbiter, communication system, lander, penetrator, and instrument suite will then be described. Each chapter will present the different challenges involved and present possible solutions to these. Each chapter will then come up with a design proposal and discuss its viability.
